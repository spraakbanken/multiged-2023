Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
sad
to
read
about
Richard
not
being
at
his
best
.

I
hope
that
he
will
recover
soon
and
that
he
will
make
it
to
our
conference
.

As
far
as
organisation
is
concerned
,
adequate
number
of
double
rooms
with
shower
or
bath
have
been
booked
for
your
group
at
the
Palace
hotel
located
across
the
main
street
from
the
train
station
.

To
come
to
our
college
,
you
can
either
watch
downhill
to
the
lake
front
(
about
10
min
)
or
take
the
new
cable
car
from
the
train
station
.

The
college
is
just
stairs
away
from
the
bottom
end
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
take
place
on
a
boat
cruising
on
the
lake
.

It
will
start
by
a
speech
from
the
Director
of
the
conference
,
followed
by
a
meal
.

The
recreative
part
will
begin
at
10
pm
with
a
short
musical
comedy
performed
by
some
of
our
students
and
end
with
fireworks
launched
from
the
roof
of
the
college
at
2
am
.

As
nights
may
be
cold
at
this
time
of
the
year
,
may
I
suggest
that
you
take
with
you
a
pullover
.

Appart
of
that
,
there
is
no
recommendation
as
to
what
to
wear
.

Depending
on
the
interests
of
your
students
,
I
would
suggest
that
you
visit
the
internet
site
of
the
tourist
office
:
www.neuchatel.ch
.

yours
sincerely

Where
are
you
?

is
very
often
the
first
question
that
you
will
be
asked
when
answering
the
phone
.

Why
?

Because
somebody
has
invented
the
most
popular
communication
device
ever
.

The
mobile
phone
.

Once
heavy
,
expensive
and
not
reliable
,
the
new
mobile
phone
fits
in
almost
any
pocket
and
is
given
away
by
the
operator
to
attract
new
customers
.

Due
to
the
mobile
phone
.

communication
has
changed
,
not
improved
.

Of
course
it
allows
to
be
reached
everywhere
(
even
in
places
you
would
n't
want
.
)

For
rescue
teams
,
it
is
a
great
help
.

But
is
n't
it
a
handicap
outside
professional
life
.

Should
n't
people
communicate
with
those
they
are
next
to
instead
of
calling
someone
2
miles
away
.

It
is
not
rare
to
see
two
people
walking
side
by
side
,
both
talking
on
the
phone
.

Would
n't
it
be
better
to
prepare
the
shopping
list
instead
of
dialing
home
to
ask
which
salad
to
buy
.

Mobile
phone
is
a
marvellous
invention
but
as
for
cigarettes
,
we
should
right
on
it

CAUTION
:
use
of
this
device
may
damage
your
brain
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith

I
am
writing
to
reply
your
letter
you
wrote
me
on
10
June
.

Firstly
,
I
would
like
to
tell
you
,
that
the
group
has
been
booked
into
Palace
Hotel
,
which
locates
beside
the
congress
house
in
the
centre
.

You
can
make
contact
with
Mrs
Brackenbury
using
the
number
06
8793888
.

Secondly
,
the
best
way
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
is
to
take
the
bus
,
which
is
specially
organized
by
us
.

The
bus
leaves
at
8:00
every
morning
and
gets
back
to
the
hotel
at
6
o'clock
in
the
evening
.

Off
course
there
's
also
a
bus
number
8
in
front
of
the
hotel
is
also
suitable
,
but
it
leaves
only
every
half
an
hour
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
which
happens
in
the
evening
on
20
June
,
is
going
to
be
held
on
the
coast
.

Beside
the
barbecue
,
there
are
some
well
-
known
student
bands
from
our
country
are
performing
music
through
the
whole
night
.

What
's
more
is
,
that
there
's
a
Latin
music
band
coming
to
make
the
party
more
colourful
.

It
plays
from
10:00
to
11:00
,
while
the
students
can
enjoy
it
with
dancing
.

The
main
events
of
the
party
will
end
up
at
about
12:30
in
the
night
.

As
you
see
,
what
to
wear
is
just
something
casual
.

Finally
,
in
the
last
afternoon
,
we
could
visit
the
museums
,
markets
(
we
have
a
very
interesting
robot
-
market
)
.

Basically
it
's
a
free
time
for
the
students
to
look
round
here
by
themselves
.

I
hope
your
questions
re
answered
appropriatly
.

I
'm
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
on
the
conference
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Computer
Life

Now
-
a
-
day
computer
can
be
found
in
almost
every
corner
,
in
offices
,
in
shops
.

Or
even
in
cars
and
washmachines
there
're
computer
chips
.

What
has
computer
affected
to
our
life
?

First
of
all
,
the
efficiency
of
the
society
has
been
improved
.

When
shopping
,
we
do
n't
need
to
wait
the
Kasse
to
take
every
article
's
note
by
hand
.

When
booking
a
airline
,
we
can
just
simply
make
a
phone
to
any
agency
,
and
get
it
done
in
one
minute
.

Secondly
,
instead
of
looking
up
tons
of
books
to
get
the
information
what
we
need
,
we
can
very
easily
search
it
from
internet
or
on
the
local
network
.

It
's
a
very
often
heard
,
that
someone
,
who
has
a
special
illness
,
gets
operations
by
a
foreign
institutes
,
which
he
find
via
internet
.

Moreover
,
with
computer
network
,
it
can
be
possible
that
people
work
from
home
,
making
projects
,
controling
operations
or
having
conferences
.

Lastly
the
way
of
communications
has
been
also
changed
.

Instead
of
the
tranditional
telecommunication
,
we
can
talk
,
mail
or
even
see
each
other
with
the
help
of
computer
network
.

Of
course
there
're
also
some
aspects
in
which
the
computer
technology
need
to
be
improved
.

For
example
,
reading
on
the
screen
is
still
not
as
comfortable
as
on
papers
.

A
very
important
and
severe
problem
is
the
reliability
and
security
.

Till
now
,
to
completely
rely
on
computer
is
still
somehow
not
safe
enough
.

In
conclusion
,
computer
have
become
a
very
essential
necessity
of
our
life
,
and
it
's
still
a
young
invention
,
which
need
to
be
improved
.

Dear
Maria

First
at
all
,
I
am
sorry
about
Richard
illness
.

Please
remember
me
to
him
and
give
him
my
best
wishes
.

About
your
request
,
I
'm
going
to
give
you
all
the
information
that
I
think
you
must
need
,
however
you
can
call
me
if
you
consider
it
necessary
,
(
my
phone
number
is
2496
9731
)
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
.

Because
it
is
a
wellkown
hotel
it
should
be
easy
to
find
it
.

Moreover
,
it
is
really
well
-
located
so
it
will
allow
you
to
move
around
the
city
without
any
problem
.

Even
more
the
conference
is
going
to
take
place
in
the
Exhibition
Centre
,
which
is
located
only
five
minutes
walking
far
from
the
Hotel
.

We
haven't
asked
for
any
special
clothes
so
I
would
wear
casual
and
comfortable
clothes
,
although
you
can
come
well
-
dressed
,
if
you
feel
better
.

After
the
conference
we
are
going
to
have
an
informal
dinner
with
a
previous
snack
time
in
order
to
introduce
each
others
.

Finally
in
my
opinion
,
you
should
visit
the
Art
Gallery
.

It
will
take
you
two
or
three
hours
but
it
's
a
gorgeous
place
.

I
look
forward
hearing
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

\"
Sagrada
Familia
\"
a
real
holly
building
.

If
you
are
looking
for
a
special
building
in
Barcelona
,
which
you
can
like
whatever
your
tastes
are
,
you
should
visit
the
\"
Sagrada
Familia
\"
.

Among
the
big
number
of
choices
,
this
unfinished
church
offers
a
gorgeous
view
fro
the
top
of
its
towers
,
a
charming
story
and
one
of
the
most
representative
examples
of
the
Catalonia
modernisme
art
.

Gaudi
conceived
this
church
n
1912
,
though
it
was
n't
until
1920
they
started
to
build
it
.

Since
the
beginning
the
work
was
interrupted
in
different
periods
and
started
again
.

After
Gaudi
death
it
was
critical
stop
which
was
fortunately
solved
three
years
later
.

Nowadays
,
a
hard
work
is
being
done
in
order
to
finish
as
soon
as
possible
.

The
visitor
can
wonder
around
all
the
building
or
follow
a
guided
visit
.

There
is
a
exhibition
room
where
maps
and
projects
can
be
consulted
.

And
,
unless
you
suffer
from
your
heart
,
you
should
climb
the
350
steps
which
carry
you
to
the
top
.

There
you
can
enjoy
a
terrific
view
,
not
only
will
you
see
almost
all
the
city
but
also
you
will
discover
another
perspective
of
this
magnific
building
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith

As
you
know
I
am
in
charge
for
organise
the
conference
in
my
college
.
Do
not
worry
if
Richard
did
not
left
you
all
the
information
.

I
am
pleased
to
help
you
.

We
looked
in
every
hotel
in
Town
trying
to
give
you
the
best
offerd
.

We
found
two
good
hotels
but
we
decided
for
the
Palace
Hotel
.

This
has
the
best
price
that
we
could
find
.

The
conference
day
our
school
driver
is
going
to
pick
you
up
in
the
hotel
and
take
you
to
the
conference
.

The
party
is
going
to
be
in
a
local
discotheque
near
the
college
so
the
best
way
to
get
there
is
walking
.

You
do
not
have
to
wear
any
special
kind
of
clothes
but
in
my
opinion
you
can
wear
very
cassual
.

Finally
,
the
last
day
I
sugget
you
to
go
to
the
mall
where
you
can
enjoy
shopping
and
looking
around
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Introduction

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
recomend
you
to
visit
the
Fuerte
de
San
Diego
Musseum
.

This
is
an
historical
building
.

I
asked
to
some
pleople
in
town
and
this
was
the
best
place
to
choose
.

History

The
Fuerte
de
Sandiego
Musseum
was
build
at
the
time
when
the
Spanish
people
was
trying
to
take
all
the
lands
from
Mexico
,
one
of
the
most
important
people
who
was
at
front
of
the
Fuerte
was
Hernon
Cortez
,
the
first
Spanish
in
have
more
lands
than
anyone
at
that
time
.

Place

The
Musseum
is
situated
in
front
of
the
sea
in
the
centre
of
Acapulco
.

Is
situated
in
the
top
of
a
little
mountain
in
the
\"
old
\"
part
on
the
city
.

You
are
able
to
get
there
by
car
or
walking
and
see
everything
which
was
made
at
that
time
.

Conclusion

On
the
whole
this
is
the
best
building
in
Acapulco
for
his
history
and
reputation
.

Is
the
best
place
to
go
and
easy
to
get
there
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

as
the
leader
of
the
conference
-
organisation
,
I
'm
glad
if
I
can
help
you
.

My
wish
is
that
nothing
goes
wrong
.

So
you
have
to
know
more
details
about
our
conference
.

Your
hotel
is
called
Palace
Hotel
and
it
is
placed
in
the
city
centre
.

As
far
as
I
know
this
hotel
is
very
comfortable
.

There
is
also
a
subway
-
station
near
Palace
Hotel
.

Our
college
is
not
much
far
away
.

You
only
have
to
take
the
subway
-
train
.

After
three
stations
you
have
arrived
Brooklyn
street
.

When
you
come
out
of
the
subway
you
see
our
college
.

The
conference
starts
at
6
o'clock
and
ends
at
8
o'clock
.

The
students
have
prepared
a
music
program
for
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

There
will
also
be
an
international
buffet
.

So
do
n't
eat
too
much
before
you
come
.

And
please
do
n't
worry
about
clothes
.

There
are
not
any
rules
.

In
our
city
there
is
a
big
adventure
swimming
park
.

I
think
you
should
visit
Water
World
on
your
last
day
.

You
will
have
a
lot
of
fund
,
I
can
tell
you
.

If
you
need
any
further
information
please
call
me
.

My
number
is
:
793354

Yours
faithfully
,

The
telephone
is
a
very
important
invention
,
which
has
affected
our
lives
.

It
is
a
way
for
people
to
communicate
although
they
are
at
two
different
places
.

People
use
the
telephone
every
day
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
in
daily
life
.

In
my
opinion
people
need
a
telephone
.

For
example
a
telephone
is
very
important
in
job
-
life
.

Nowadays
there
are
no
companies
which
do
not
have
a
telephone
.

Also
it
is
god
for
people
's
safety
.

You
can
call
the
police
if
you
are
in
danger
or
the
ambulance
if
you
are
injured
.

The
people
use
the
telephone
also
for
their
personal
life
.

For
example
when
you
want
to
talk
to
your
family
or
to
your
friends
who
live
far
away
.

Another
aspect
is
that
people
have
more
time
if
they
have
a
telephone
.

They
are
able
to
give
and
receive
informations
very
quickly
.

This
invention
has
made
our
lives
easier
and
quickier
.

The
telephone
has
made
my
own
life
also
easy
and
quick
.

It
makes
something
possible
you
can
not
do
.

Finally
I
would
say
that
the
telephone
is
very
efficient
for
people
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
to
reply
to
your
letter
and
to
give
answers
to
your
questions
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
,
a
five
star
hotel
,
which
offers
many
facilities
.

It
is
famous
for
its
friendly
staff
and
comfortable
rooms
.

The
students
can
get
there
with
the
No
35
bus
.

They
must
get
on
the
bus
from
the
city
centre
and
get
off
after
five
stations
at
Palace
Station
.

The
hotel
is
opposite
the
station
.

At
the
end
-
of
-
conference
the
college
,
in
which
the
conference
will
be
held
,
gives
a
party
for
all
the
students
.

It
will
be
offered
light
food
,
like
sandwiches
,
pommes
frites
,
chips
,
sweets
and
different
drinks
-
no
alcohol
.

There
will
be
life
music
and
the
students
can
dance
and
enjoy
themselves
.

It
would
be
better
to
wear
casual
clothes
,
because
they
are
more
comfortable
and
are
liked
by
students
.

On
the
last
day
,
the
students
can
enjoy
a
sightseeing
tour
around
the
city
,
which
can
be
arranged
if
the
students
want
to
.

The
group
can
also
visit
the
zoo
,
the
opera
or
stay
and
relax
at
the
college
's
enormous
garden
and
enjoy
the
settings
.

Do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
if
you
require
further
information
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
.

sincerely

:
At
the
castle
are
always
few
guides
,
who
will
show
someone
around
and
tell
him
about
the
history
of
the
castle
(
when
it
was
built
,
by
whom
and
why
)
,
which
makes
everyone
enthousistic
.

RECOMMENDATION

I
recomment
to
visit
this
castle
,
because
it
is
interesting
,
marvelous
and
something
different
.

It
is
the
favourite
place
of
all
the
tourists
who
visit
Nyremberg
.

Nyremberg
is
also
famous
for
this
castle
and
the
students
will
have
a
different
expirience
and
a
lesson
too
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
with
reference
to
your
last
letter
concerning
the
international
student
conference
in
our
college
.

I
would
get
you
the
information
you
are
requested
.

First
of
all
,
we
have
booked
the
Palace
Hotel
for
your
group
.

This
hotel
is
quiet
and
near
the
conference
building
.

However
,
I
would
suggest
going
by
bus
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
because
this
is
the
most
convenient
form
of
transport
.

Furthermore
,
as
usually
,
we
would
organise
a
party
at
the
end
of
the
conference
,
therefore
,
it
would
be
great
if
your
students
wear
a
suit
(
for
man
)
or
a
skirt
(
for
woman
)
.

Furthermore
,
this
party
would
be
in
your
hotel
like
the
following
years
.

Finally
,
there
are
a
lot
of
mouseum
is
our
town
,
therefore
,
I
would
suggest
going
to
the
frogs
museum
which
is
really
fashinating
.

Do
n't
hesitate
to
contact
me
if
you
need
any
further
information
.

Yours
sincerly
,

Arboriginal
Art
Museum
.

The
aim
of
this
report
is
intended
to
discribe
the
biggest
building
of
our
town
.

I
am
in
a
position
to
choose
a
good
building
which
students
like
myself
are
interested
in
.

this
museum
presents
more
than
200000
original
art
pictures
.

b
)
The
building
has
been
buit
in
1999
,
therefore
,
it
is
a
modern
architecture
.

c
)
This
building
is
as
high
as
the
Eiffel
Tour
in
Paris
.

d
)
This
building
is
included
:
30
toilets
,
500'000
lights
,
and
also
100
people
whom
can
help
you
if
you
need
any
information
.

I
would
suggest
this
place
because
it
is
interesting
to
discover
the
eldest
civilisation
of
the
world
in
one
of
the
modernest
building
.

Mrs
Smith
,

I
received
your
letter
this
morning
and
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
your
interest
in
the
Conference
.

I
hope
I
can
answer
your
questions
.

At
First
,
this
international
student
conference
has
the
intension
of
explain
to
students
how
important
is
the
education
.

In
addition
to
this
,
we
choose
the
luxuery
Palace
Hotel
which
is
comfortable
enough
and
in
a
good
location
.

The
Palace
Hotel
is
located
in
the
centre
of
the
city
,
so
you
can
go
by
train
,
by
bus
or
by
car
.

I
suggest
you
should
go
by
train
and
go
out
in
the
Museum
Station
.

The
Conference
will
happen
in
the
Hotel
,
which
is
so
much
easier
.

The
Conference
,
not
being
modest
,
it
is
a
quite
well
organized
.

It
will
starts
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
will
finish
around
five
in
the
afternoon
.

I
suggest
you
should
wear
something
informal
.

Even
though
we
want
to
make
things
as
more
comfortable
as
possible
to
our
students
.

I
am
very
happy
that
you
want
to
know
my
area
,
although
I
am
afraid
an
afternoon
is
not
enough
.

However
,
if
you
want
,
you
can
call
me
and
I
can
show
you
some
interesting
places
.
I
will
be
very
glad
.

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Affecting
Our
Lifes

Cars
,
boats
,
motobikes
,
airplanes
:
Who
did
never
use
this
once
?

This
is
a
good
question
.

The
humans
seems
always
that
they
are
running
and
the
fastest
of
this
inventions
is
certainly
,
the
airplane
.

At
First
,
when
Santos
Dummont
invented
the
airplane
,
he
probably
did
n't
think
how
the
people
could
transform
his
creation
.

In
this
world
,
where
the
nations
fight
to
be
the
better
one
could
n't
be
diferent
:
the
airplane
became
the
most
important
thing
in
the
war
.

Unfortunately
,
it
was
used
to
kill
a
lot
of
people
.

However
,
the
invention
of
the
airplane
has
brought
us
some
facilities
.

How
could
a
person
come
from
Brazil
to
Australia
?

Maybe
by
boat
,
but
it
could
take
too
long
!

The
best
way
is
definetely
,
by
air
.

After
this
invention
travel
around
the
world
is
so
much
easier
.

Now
,
we
have
to
say
thanks
and
congratulate
all
the
creators
who
invented
facility
things
for
us
.

So
,
the
airplane
is
definitely
an
important
invention
,
because
it
have
changed
people
's
life
in
wars
.

Until
now
,
it
is
being
important
in
the
transport
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
around
the
world
.

Let
's
congratulate
Santos
Dummont
!

Dear
Mrs

have
to
wear
spezial
clothes
,

take
your
uniform
with

to
leave
it
at

hotel

and
wear
something
else

Dear
Maria
Smith
,

I
receved
your
letter
and
I
'm
happy
to
help
you
.
We
booked
the
Palace
Hotel
for
your
group
,
it
's
nice
and
quiet
.

I
'm
sure
you
'll
be
fine
here
.

We
chose
the
Palace
Hotel
because
it
's
near
our
college
,
too
.

So
you
are
going
to
come
at
the
conference
in
some
minutes
.

When
you
go
out
of
the
Hotel
turn
right
and
go
stright
on
,
at
the
first
crossroads
turn
right
again
.

At
the
end
of
this
street
you
can
see
our
college
on
your
left
,
it
's
a
green
building
.

At
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
it
'll
be
something
to
eat
and
to
drink
.

In
the
big
room
where
we
'll
have
the
party
,
it
'll
be
some
picturs
of
our
college
,
you
'll
see
al
the
generations
who
passed
here
.

The
wears
are
n't
very
important
,
but
it
'll
be
fine
if
the
people
will
wear
something
different
from
the
usual
jeans
.

Here
we
have
a
lot
of
beautiful
things
to
do
,
but
the
best
you
can
do
in
about
three
hours
is
visiting
the
painting
museum
.

We
all
are
looking
forward
to
seeing
your
group

TELEVISION

What
would
our
world
be
without
television
?

It
is
n't
easy
giving
an
answer
at
this
question
.

Television
is
an
important
invention
,
it
permitted
us
to
better
our
way
of
communication
.

This
animated
box
can
give
us
a
lot
of
informations
coming
from
all
around
the
world
.

Television
has
affected
the
\"
all
days
life
,
,
,
too
.
We
can
spend
a
lot
of
time
enjoying
ourselves
with
some
programs
,
all
what
we
have
to
do
is
watching
.

And
we
like
that
,
because
it
's
easier
nothing
doing
than
engaging
ourselves
in
something
that
make
us
do
something
.

So
television
can
be
a
positive
or
a
negative
invention
,
it
depends
on
which
use
we
want
to
do
of
this
box
.

Now
we
should
be
able
to
answer
at
the
introducing
question
.

No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.

Television
has
become
so
important
for
us
that
we
ca
n't
thinking
that
it
could
n't
exist
.

Dear

first
walk

the

to
the
Town
Hall
railway
station
,
which
is
North
City
Line
,
is
yellow
line
on
the
map
.

After
getting
on
the
train
,
you
should
get
off
at
the
Mountain
station
which
is

twenty
minutes
,
is

Yours
sincerely

Dear
Mr
Wolf

I
am
writing
to
answer
your
question
about
the
information
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

I
would
like
to
introduce
one
building
in
my
town
.

\"
Sky
Heaven
\"
which
is
the
name
of
the
building
,
is
for
fifteen
minutes
from
the
centre
of
my
town
.

This
building
have
a
hundred
floor
and
it
takes
for
five
minutes
from
the
grand
to
the
top
in
the
elevator
.

There
are
many
facilities
which
are
a
museum
,
a
exhibition
and
many
gift
shops
where
we
might
also
enjoy
going
shopping
.

The
reason
for
my
recommendation
is
that
Sky
Heaven
is
the
highest
building
in
the
world
.

You
should
get
the
top
of
the
building
and
experience
such
a
amazing
view
.

Another
reason
is
that
there
is
a
good
museum
,
which
tell
you
about
the
history
of
my
town
so
easily
and
clearly
.

It
is
a
good
experience
for
your
students
.

I
hope
you
will
accept
my
recommendation
and
am
looking
forward
to
hearing
from
you
soon
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
glad
to
helping
you
for
the
organisation
of
the
international
student
conference
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
,
and
the
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
by
tube
,
the
building
of
the
conference
is
then
five
minutes
by
footh
.

At
the
end
-
of
-
conference
there
is
a
party
,
where
we
can
eat
something
,
dance
and
speak
to
each
other
about
the
conference
.

For
the
party
I
suggest
you
to
wear
classic
clothes
;
maybe
something
black
and
not
red
or
pink
.
I
am
going
to
wear
black
classic
trousers
and
a
white
jorsey
-
it
can
be
that
this
information
give
you
some
idea
too
..

On
the
last
day
we
are
going
to
have
about
three
hours
free
times
.

What
do
you
think
if
we
will
go
to
visit
the
Arts
Museum
?

Of
if
we
will
go
to
hear
a
classic
concert
near
the
conference
building
's
?

I
hope
that
I
have
been
able
to
give
you
some
help
.

and
I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
at
the
conference
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Morgan
,

I
am
writing
a
report
,
which
will
describe
you
the
most
important
building
of
my
town
.

The
most
important
building
of
Biasco
is
the
,
,
Casa
Cavalier
Pellanda
\"
.

It
is
an
old
big
house
of
a
rich
lord
in
the
middle
of
the
town
.

Into
this
house
there
is
a
big
museum
,
where
you
could
know
the
past
of
Biasco
.

Under
the
museum
there
is
a
big
dark
place
,
where
the
wine
is
produced
.

Your
American
students
could
learn
how
the
,
,
Meriot
ticinese
\"
is
produced
and
why
is
it
so
famous
in
Tiano
.

I
think
that
these
suggestions
could
interest
your
student
then
Biasco
,
with
its
,
,
Casa
Cavalier
Pellanda
\"
,
is
the
middle
points
of
two
tailes
-
Leventina
and
Blenio
-
and
the
middle
points
of
two
similar
but
also
different
cultures
too
.

I
hope
that
these
informations
will
bring
you
to
visit
Biasco
and
its
,
,
house
\"
.

Yours
faithfully
,

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
Richard
Brown
is
n't
well
and
hope
he
'll
get
better
soon
.
I
am
more
than
happy
to
give
you
the
nessessary
information
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
into
Palace
Hotel
which
is
only
2
miles
away
from
our
college
.

The
college
will
arrange
a
mini
-
bus
to
come
and
pick
you
up
every
morning
at
8:45
,
so
you
can
arrive
to
the
college
around
9
o'clock
and
have
some
time
before
the
conference
starts
at
9:15
.

The
reason
we
do
n't
suggest
you
to
take
a
walk
from
your
hotel
is
that
you
'd
have
to
walk
through
a
large
building
site
which
is
not
going
to
be
suitable
for
a
group
of
20
students
.

As
you
already
know
we
are
going
to
have
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
where
the
Head
of
the
college
will
give
a
small
speech
at
the
begining
,
then
it
will
a
buffet
and
a
disco
.

You
do
n't
need
to
dress
up
smartly
but
please
,
make
sure
that
your
students
do
n't
wear
short
or
trainers
.

Regarding
to
what
you
could
do
in
your
free
afternoon
on
the
day
you
leave
I
would
suggest
you
to
take
the
students
to
our
History
Museim
.

It
's
not
very
big
but
it
has
got
some
amazing
information
about
the
history
of
our
town
and
their
people
.

There
is
also
a
gift
shop
in
there
,
where
your
boys
and
girls
can
buy
some
soveniers
for
their
families
and
friends
.

I
hope
I
've
answered
all
your
questions
but
if
you
need
anymore
information
,
please
let
me
know
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
all
soon
.

Best
regards
,

To
my
personal
opinion
one
of
the
most
important
and
useful
thing
which
has
been
invented
in
a
car
.

Cars
take
a
big
part
in
our
life
.

Everywhere
you
look
you
can
see
cars
.

More
and
more
people
learn
how
to
drive
and
choose
to
travel
by
car
,
because
it
saves
a
lot
of
time
comper
to
travelling
by
public
transport
.

Cars
are
also
more
reliable
than
other
types
of
transport
.

You
do
n't
have
to
wait
on
a
bus
stop
on
a
cold
and
windy
weather
for
a
late
bus
,
or
being
stuck
on
a
train
for
an
hour
due
to
some
railtrack
repairs
,
you
can
just
jump
into
a
car
,
tune
your
radio
onto
your
favourite
station
and
have
a
plesant
drive
to
your
distanation
.

Cars
are
even
more
important
for
emergency
situations
such
as
fire
in
a
house
or
if
somebody
is
critically
ill
.

Could
you
imagine
if
our
police
,
doctors
or
fire
-
fighters
had
to
get
somewhere
quickly
on
foot
?

I
do
n't
think
I
need
to
comment
on
this
.

From
my
personal
experience
I
realised
how
it
's
important
to
drive
a
car
when
I
was
living
in
Johanesburg
in
South
Africa
.

I
arrived
there
with
my
family
when
my
daughter
was
only
4
months
old
and
I
could
n't
drive
at
that
time
.

Johanesburg
is
a
very
dangerous
place
to
live
.

I
could
n't
just
go
for
a
walk
,
it
was
too
dangerous
.

There
was
no
public
transport
and
I
had
to
stay
in
the
complex
where
we
lived
most
of
the
time
,
and
relay
on
other
people
to
take
me
to
a
shop
or
the
doctors
or
anywhere
else
.

There
I
soon
realised
that
I
had
to
learn
how
to
drive
if
I
wanted
a
quality
life
for
my
daughter
and
myself
.

Since
I
passed
my
driving
test
I
can
not
understand
how
I
used
to
live
without
a
car
before
.

I
use
my
car
every
day
everywhere
I
go
and
I
absolutelly
love
it
!

12th
June
2001

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
to
inform
you
some
information
about
an
international
student
conference
.

First
of
all
,
the
hotel
which
the
group
has
been
booked
into
is
The
Princes
Hotel
.

It
is
very
near
York
Railway
Station
which
you
can
get
there
easily
.

By
rail
:
get
off
at
York
station
and
you
can
walk
from
the
station
turn
left
and
the
hotel
is
on
your
left
hand
side
.

By
bus
:
most
of
the
buses
in
York
City
Centre
pass
the
station
,
or
you
can
take
a
taxi
.

Secondly
,
the
conference
is
very
important
event
for
all
of
us
,
we
agree
to
wear
formal
dresses
.

For
example
,
men
should
wear
suits
,
ties
and
the
so
on
.

In
addition
,
at
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
we
also
have
a
country
dancing
show
.

It
could
be
very
special
because
all
the
dancers
are
from
our
group
.

Finally
,
on
the
last
day
we
have
an
afternoon
free
.

It
would
be
grateful
If
we
could
go
for
a
walk
around
the
city
of
York
and
visit
the
historic
buildings
.

If
you
could
think
of
any
other
ideas
It
would
be
very
kind
of
you
.
I
would
be
grateful
if
my
idea
and
all
the
information
could
help
you
.

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Inventions
have
affected
all
our
lives
!

Nowadays
,
a
lot
of
things
are
invented
and
make
our
lives
are
more
convenient
than
those
days
.

A
car
is
one
of
the
invention
which
is
very
useful
.

I
think
a
car
is
very
important
to
me
because
it
's
very
convenient
for
everyday
life
.

For
example
,
I
can
travel
to
many
places
in
the
U.K.
Especially
,
I
live
in
Whitwell
-
on
-
the
-
Hill
(
a
village
near
Malton
in
North
Yorkshire
)
.

Can
you
imagine
if
I
had
n't
got
a
car
how
could
I
go
shopping
,
go
to
college
and
so
on
?

In
fact
,
there
are
buses
(
number
843
and
845
)
which
go
pass
my
village
but
the
bus
fares
is
very
expensive
for
me
.

Apart
from
that
it
takes
long
time
to
go
somewhere
.

The
car
has
largely
affected
my
own
life
.

I
can
go
anywhere
by
car
a
lot
quicker
than
use
public
transports
.

I
can
listen
to
the
radio
and
sometimes
can
listen
to
Thai
music
which
I
brought
some
cassets
with
me
from
Thailand
.

I
took
a
car
driving
theory
test
last
October
and
I
passed
it
and
I
will
take
a
pratice
driving
test
very
soon
.

I
think
I
have
to
drive
the
car
myself
,
so
that
it
will
know
more
about
the
advantages
of
using
the
car
.

In
conclusion
,
I
think
car
is
very
important
to
me
and
it
has
affected
my
own
life
.

If
I
have
more
money
I
will
buy
another
car
.
I
think
it
has
more
advantages
than
disadvantages
.

So
,
we
should
say
many
thanks
to
the
person
who
invented
a
car
!

Dear
Mrs
Smith

It
was
such
a

to
receive

me
give
you
some
further
information
concerning
the
event
.

I
would
like
to
inform
you
about
the

have
already
booked
for
you
.

and
we
hope
that

to
satisfy
your
expectetions
.

too

I
strongly
reccommend
you

the
public
transportation
in
order
to
get

,
cause
you
may
be
find
other
types
of

quite
expensive
.

must
be
aware
of
the
fact
that

hours

night
,
with
traditional
local
music
that
you
must
not
miss
.

You
do
n't
need
to
wear
formal
clothes
.

Just
every
day
clothes
.

Finally
,
I
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
last
day
you

some
hours
free

you

Your

THE
HYSTORICAL
MUSEUM

Welcome

Athens
!
!

Without

,
a

place
which
provides
it
's
visitors
with
the
opportunity
to
discover
different
aspects
of
the
greek
history
during
the
passing
of
centuries
.

Do
n't
miss
the
chance
to
visit
the
hystorical
museum
,
located
in
the
heart
of
the
capital
city
.

A
traditional
building
which
was
built
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
.

The
hystorical
museum
is
simply
a
symbol
,
a
proof
of
what
greek
have
always
considered
as
main
principal
:
their
freedom
.

There
are
five
diffrent
floors
,
each
of
them
presents
a
diffrent
chronical
period
of
greek
history
,
starting
from
the
period
before
the
birth
of
Juisus
and
concluding
to
the
revolution
of
1967
.

The
museum
provides
the
visitor
with
the
opportunity
to
see
original
pieces
of
writing
,
famous
paintings
having
as
main
subject
the
revolution
of
1821
,
and
aspects
of
the
greek
religion
that
has
always
considered
to
be
vital
part
of
greek
history
.

There
is
a
small
amount
of
money
that
visitors
should
pay
for
entry
.

Inside
the
museum
there
is
bookshop
having
a
large
variety
of
hystorical
books
,
maps
etc
.

If
you
really
want
to
discover
what
greek
history
means
,
we
strongly
recommend
you
to
visit
the
hystorical
museum
!
!
!

Dear
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
and
I
will
try
to
help
you
.

I
will
remind
you
that
the
international
student
conference
will
be
the
next
month
on
the
first
of
July
.

The
hotel
that
we
booked
was
the
Palace
Hotel
which
is
near
the
bus
station
.

When
you
are
in
the
bus
station
you
will
catch
the
bus
number
37
which
will
go
to
town
center
.

From
there
you
will
walk
until
the
college
because
it
is
easier
to
get
there
than
to
get
with
another
bus
.

Anyway
the
college
is
the
first
road
on
your
right
from
town
center
.

After
the
conference
some
drink
and
food
will
be
available
in
the
sport
-
center
which
is
well
equipped
for
disco
-
party
.

Our
party
has
a
special
subject
'
Western
'
.

So
we
suggest
to
wear
western
clothes
.

On
your
last
day
you
could
go
to
the
sport
-
musseum
which
is
grateful
and
famous
around
the
world
or
only
go
for
a
walk
around
Reconvillier
-
Park
.

I
hope
that
I
had
answer
all
of
your
question
and
that
the
conference
will
be
grateful
.

Yours
sincerely
.

From
:

To
:
the
group
leader

Subject
:
old
Roman
School
.

Introduction
:
I
am
writing
to
explain
you
about
the
location
,
the
architecture
and
the
story
of
the
old
Roman
school
from
Courtelary
.
I
hope
that
you
will
get
there
with
your
group
because
it
has
a
lot
of
beautiful
thing
to
see
.

It
is
the
unique
old
Roman
school
in
the
world
.

Location
:
Courtelary
is
situated
in
Switzerland
and
the
school
is
on
the
top
of
the
town
's
hill
.

This
place
is
very
important
because
it
is
there
that
an
Emperor
had
growing
up
.

Architecture
:
It
is
a
typical
from
this
epoque
with
beautiful
draw
on
the
wall
and
first
kind
of
writing
in
the
sport
center
.

The
door
is
enormous
because
for
them
the
entry
was
the
most
important
.

History
:
All
began
when
Ogus
Micius
said
that
Roman
need
to
go
at
school
.

They
decided
to
build
more
school
specially
in
Switzerland
because
the
people
were
considerated
clever
.

During
the
Second
World
War
all
school
were
demolished
only
our
is
left
.

Conclusion
:
I
gave
you
a
lot
of
reason
to
get
in
this
building
and
I
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
trip
in
my
town
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
am
writing
to
answering
our
question
.

Firstly
,
I
already
have
booked
Palace
Hotel
for
the
students
.

There
is
the
hotel
near
my
college
.

It
takes
five
minutes
to
get
my
college
by
walking
.

I
will
copy
the
map
around
the
college
.

Secondly
,
I
will
tell
you
about
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

It
will
start
at
six
o'clock
.

The
party
will
be
held
in
the
dinning
room
.

People
who
will
attend
the
party
are
many
professers
,
semi
-
professers
and
faculties
.

So
I
suggest
that
the
students
should
wear
formal
clothes
.

Finally
,
I
will
give
you
some
ideas
for
an
afternoon
free
time
.

The
city
in
which
there
is
my
college
is
traditional
in
my
country
.

For
example
,
there
are
many
shrines
,
temples
,
and
castles
.

I
suggest
that
you
should
visit
these
places
.

You
will
have
a
good
time
.

In
addition
,
there
are
many
other
colleges
.

You
will
be
able
to
see
many
Japanese
students
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
at
the
conference
.

If
you
would
like
to
gain
more
information
,
you
will
ask
me
everytime
.

Yours
sincerely
.

I
suggest
that
you
should
visit
one
building
.

My
town
is
the
capital
of
Japan
.

So
there
are
many
higher
buildings
.

I
think
it
is
like
New
York
.

However
,
I
have
only
one
building
which
I
want
you
to
visit
.

The
name
of
the
building
is
'
Sunshine
60
'
.

This
is
the
highest
building
in
Tokyo
.
I
recommend
to
visit
.

I
have
three
reasons
for
my
recommendation
.

Firstly
,
there
is
the
acquerium
in
the
building
.

In
addition
,
this
is
the
60th
floor
,
I
went
there
first
time
I
could
n't
believed
it
.

Secondly
,
if
you
visit
there
,
you
will
see
everywhere
in
Tokyo
.

The
scene
of
Tokyo
is
not
beautiful
,
but
you
think
that
this
city
is
a
developing
place
.

On
the
other
hand
you
may
think
what
a
small
city
it
is
!
!

Finally
,
there
are
many
shops
inside
the
building
.
You
will
have
a
good
time
for
shopping
.

I
hope
when
you
visit
,
you
will
be
favorite
place
.

You
should
visit
there
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,
Thank
you
for
your
letter
of
asking
for
my
help
to
the
conference
.

I
would
like
to
help
you
with
my
best
.

Firstly
,
Palace
Hotel
has
been
booked
into
for
the
group
accomodation
and
I
spoke
with
the
hotel
manager
for
traveling
to
the
conference
.

The
hotel
has
their
own
buses
,
they
will
pick
us
from
hotel
to
the
conference
saloon
.

Secondly
,
I
would
like
to
tell
more
about
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.
I
booked
Palace
Hotel
's
restaurant
for
our
party
and
it
is
big
enough
for
your
students
.

It
is
going
to
be
very
lovely
and
enjoyable
because
I
have
lots
of
surprises
for
students
.

In
addition
,
I
suggest
that
they
should
wear
sporty
and
comfortable
clothes
.

Finally
,
you
would
like
to
know
some
activities
for
three
hours
free
time
.

I
think
you
can
go
to
the
'
Dreamland
'
.

In
this
place
there
is
video
games
,
some
little
competitions
and
small
zoo
available
.

Students
can
enjoy
their
time
in
this
place
and
it
is
on
the
way
of
the
airport
.

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.

Your
sincerely

Re
:
Information
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit

Introduction

Here
is
my
report
for
American
students
who
want
information
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit
in
Ankara
.

I
would
like
to
describe
'
Anitkabir
'

Findings

1
.
This
building
's
name
is
'
Anitkabir
'
and
it
is
the
biggest
building
in
Ankara
.

It
built
in
1953
.

It
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
.

There
is
different
kind
of
bird
and
different
kind
of
trees
present
.

2
.

It
has
very
big
museum
inside
the
building
and
all
building
made
from
stone
.

3
.
This
building
's
security
guards
are
very
special
soldiers
.

Their
aim
is
to
protect
the
building
from
the
enemies
because
there
is
also
very
big
army
museum
available
.

4
.

It
has
no
charge
for
entrance
and
it
has
a
good
view
for
tourists
to
seeing
Ankara
from
the
hill
.

It
opens
at
8.00
am
to
5.00
pm

Recommendations

I
recommend
that
it
is
the
best
building
in
Ankara
to
visit
because
it
includes
all
Turkish
history
and
very
good
sight
seeing
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
reply
to
your
letter
about
the
internation
student
conference
.

The
hotel
which
we
have
reserved
for
your
group
is
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
not
far
from
our
college
,
taking
20
minutes
by
car
.

It
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
a
taxi
from
the
hotel
to
the
college
because
the
total
members
of
your
group
are
4
and
taxi
fare
would
not
be
expensive
.

There
is
a
taxi
rank
opposite
the
hotel
.

Regarding
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
on
Thursday
,
it
starts
at
7
p.m.
in
the
garden
of
the
college
.

You
can
wear
either
casual
dresses
or
fancy
ones
because
we
have
a
fancy
-
dress
competition
and
the
raffle
is
a
bottle
of
French
champaign
.

On
Friday
afternoon
,
it
has
set
to
be
a
free
time
.

Therefore
,
you
can
go
shopping
in
the
town
centre
which
is
near
the
college
.

Many
beautiful
and
traditional
souvenirs
can
be
found
there
.

The
other
suggestion
is
going
to
the
flower
market
where
is
very
famous
for
tourists
because
it
covers
2
acres
and
there
are
plenty
of
flowers
to
buy
.

Moreover
,
it
is
the
biggest
flower
market
in
this
area
.

I
look
forward
to
meeting
you
soon
and
hope
you
have
a
safe
journey
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Invented
Light

There
are
many
sources
of
light
in
this
world
such
as
sunlight
,
moonlight
,
candle
light
.

Some
of
them
are
natural
whereas
the
others
are
not
.

Owing
to
increasing
demand
of
light
for
more
activities
,
the
natural
source
is
not
adequate
.

There
,
electric
light
has
invented
.

Nowadays
,
the
electric
light
has
been
becoming
part
of
our
lives
,
especially
during
the
night
.

Whatever
we
do
at
night
,
we
need
the
electric
light
.

Have
you
ever
imaged
how
this
world
would
be
if
there
was
no
electric
light
?

It
must
have
been
a
big
impact
on
industry
,
agriculture
and
our
lifestyle
.

Think
about
when
the
electricity
in
your
house
got
a
short
circuit
.

Do
you
feel
uncomfortable
?

Could
you
do
anything
much
without
light
?

In
addition
,
the
electric
light
is
the
manuscript
of
other
electric
equipments
and
they
has
become
an
important
part
of
our
life
,
too
.

I
think
we
should
be
grateful
that
we
have
got
the
electric
light
for
comforting
our
lifestyle
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
was
very
please
to
receive
your
letter
.

It
is
my
pleasure
to
help
you
organising
the
international
student
conference
.

Firstly
,
for
your
information
,
the
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
located
on
the
town
centre
.

Students
can
take
the
airport
bus
to
the
hotel
directly
when
you
arrive
.

And
the
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
to
by
coach
,
as
there
are
about
35
internation
students
,
they
are
all
strangers
here
.

Therefore
it
is
no
good
taking
a
bus
.

I
will
help
you
to
book
the
coach
.

Secondly
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
be
held
at
college
main
hall
,
at
8:00
pm
to
11:30
pm
on
20th
June
.

There
will
be
various
kinds
of
food
and
drinks
provided
.

Moreover
,
students
can
dance
and
enjoy
different
sorts
of
music
,
for
instance
,
rock
,
jazz
,
pop
,
garage
and
so
on
.

Furthermore
,
I
suggest
you
and
the
students
wearing
pub
-
wears
to
it
,
as
it
is
suitable
for
dancing
.

Finally
,
on
the
last
day
,
I
suggest
you
could
go
the
market
at
town
during
the
3-hour
gap
.

It
is
a
nice
place
to
buy
the
British
style
gifts
to
your
family
and
friends
.

You
could
also
enjoy
the
tea
at
the
cafés
nearby
.

I
would
be
grateful
to
give
any
help
if
you
need
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Group
leader
of
American
students

Subject
:
Interesting
building
to
visit
in
Hong
Kong

Visiting
Po
Lin
Temple

The
purpose
of
this
is
to
give
information
to
the
American
students
,
describing
Po
Lin
Temple
is
worth
-
visited
.

1
.

Brief
history
of
Po
Lin
Temple
:

It
was
found
in
1910
.

It
is
a
traditional
type
of
chinese
temple
.

Because
of
the
2nd
World
War
,
it
was
re
-
built
in
1960
.

A
big
Buhha
was
built
in
1997
just
next
to
the
temple
,
which
is
the
largest
outdoor
Buhha
in
the
world
.

2
.
Location
:

The
location
of
Po
Lin
Temple
is
in
Lotus
Island
,
which
is
the
second
biggest
island
in
Hong
Kong
.

3
.

Opening
and
Closing
time
:

Po
Lin
Temple
is
opened
to
public
from
8:00
am
to
6:00
pm
on
Monday
to
Friday
,
and
9:00
am
to
5:30
pm
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
.

4
.
Transports

You
could
take
the
MTR
(
HK
underground
)
straight
to
Lotus
Island
or
take
the
ferry
to
get
there
.

Then
you
need
to
take
the
bus
A110
,
A111
or
A112
to
Po
Lin
Temple
.

It
is
quite
convenient
.

All
the
buses
and
MTR
have
air
-
condition
.

5
.

Attractive
points
:

You
could
go
sightseeing
around
the
Temple
and
take
photos
.

Of
course
,
you
may
get
more
knowledge
about
Hong
Kong
,
as
the
temple
have
been
here
for
nearly
100
years
.

The
well
known
Big
Buhha
you
must
n't
miss
it
,
or
you
will
be
sorry
.

The
temple
also
provide
free
Chinese
traditional
style
meals
for
visitors
.

6
.

Conclusion
:

To
sum
up
,
I
think
Po
Lin
Temple
is
a
nice
place
to
visit
,
especially
for
Americans
students
.

Easy
to
get
there
and
free
amittion
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Hong
Kong
is
known
as
a
highly
commerical
city
,
but
you
could
find
something
different
in
Po
Lin
Temple
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

First
of
all
I
'm
sorry
to
hear
that
Richard
Brown
is
ill
.

As
you
are
the
leader
of
a
group
instead
of
him
,
I
'm
delighted
to
give
all
the
information
you
have
asked
for
.

The
Palace
Hotel
has
been
booked
for
the
group
,
and
from
there
to
the
conference
,
we
have
organized
with
the
hotel
's
bus
service
to
take
the
student
to
the
conference
.

We
will
meet
at
the
lobby
at
9.00
AM
.

The
conference
party
will
last
at
1.00
AM
,
but
every
body
do
not
need
to
stay
until
the
end
.

There
will
be
a
bus
taking
students
who
do
not
need
to
stay
at
the
party
until
the
end
.

The
bus
will
be
service
at
9.30
PM
and
11.30
PM
then
at
the
end
of
the
party
will
be
the
last
one
.

Everybody
are
free
to
dress
for
the
party
but
be
considering
to
be
appropriate
.

On
the
last
day
at
noon
,
you
could
go
to
the
craft
centre
near
by
the
Airport
.

There
are
lots
of
thing
there
you
will
enjoy
watching
or
buying
for
friends
.

there
is
any
information
you
need

conference
,
please

Telephone
saved
my
friendship

It
's
very
hard
to
decide
which
invention
is
the
best
.

Because
all
of
them
are
so
important
in
difference
way
.

As
now
I
'm
being
away
from
home
,
telephone
is
very
important
to
me
.

Having
telephone
I
can
call
my
mother
,
my
friends
which
helping
me
from
home
sick
,
not
completely
but
I
think
it
's
better
than
other
ways
.

To
hear
the
voice
from
the
person
you
love
is
the
feelling
that
hard
to
describe
,
it
's
wonderful
and
so
real
,
you
can
imagine
their
face
clearly
.

I
had
a
problem
with
my
best
friend
once
when
we
keep
in
tuch
through
e
-
mail
.

The
problem
is
the
language
,
we
used
English
but
we
both
were
not
very
good
at
it
by
the
time
which
made
us
misunderstand
each
other
.

However
,
the
problem
solved
by
a
telephone
.

We
are
now
still
friend
.

Thanks
to
the
invention
of
the
telephone
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith

With
reference
to
the
information
that
you
had
requested
,
the
hotel
that
had
been
booked
is
the
Holiday
Inn
,
in
New
Port
and
to
get
to
the
University
of
Wales
wich
is
not
far
from
the
hotel
,
you
only
need
to
take
a
divertion
where
clearly
indicate
Carleon
and
once
that
you
are
on
the
main
road
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
follow
the
country
road
which
take
you
direct
to
the
place
.

Concerning
to
the
Party
at
the
end
of
the
Conference
,
this
will
be
formal
there
fore
you
will
need
formal
clouding
as
you
know
there
will
be
Company
directors
,
Managers
etc
.

As
for
the
last
day
I
would
suggest
you
to
take
a
visit
to
the
locall
museum
and
the
ruin
's
Castle
.

In
the
fist
you
will
find
a
very
intresting
collection
of
Roman
Vestiges
,
also
you
can
visit
another
section
wich
it
supoused
to
be
a
Roman
cite
.

Yours
Sincerely
,

I
always
had
consider
myself
been
very
looky
to
be
born
in
the
Century
because
all
the
amaizing
human
inventions
.

As
an
example
let
's
have
a
look
and
we
will
see
of
this
nation
how
it
has
developed
.

We
just
need
to
think
about
the
first
world
wold
and
all
the
inventions
created
thanks
to
the
industrial
revolution
to
these
day
.

However
I
feel
that
at
the
moment
there
should
emerge
more
grups
to
control
this
development
because
the
industrial
polution
that
it
has
been
created
and
it
seems
that
its
very
little
what
has
been
done
at
the
moment
in
relation
to
our
embiroment
.

I
hope
in
the
future
there
will
be
more
and
more
people
interested
in
this
important
issue
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
read
your
letters
and
I
'm
ready
to
help
you
.

I
think
that
we
have
to
think
which
hotel
is
better
for
the
students
.

I
have
an
idea
and
I
think
that
you
will
agree
with
me
.

I
was
thinking
about
the
Palace
Hotel
because
it
's
very
nice
and
cheap
.

It
has
comfortable
bedrooms
and
place
for
parties
.

You
can
book
this
hotel
it
's
the
best
and
it
's
near
to
conference
it
's
only
15
minutes
by
walk
.

I
think
that
it
will
be
nice
about
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
if
you
will
invite
somebody
to
sing
and
give
to
the
student
the
time
to
enjoy
theirselves
and
to
dance
.

The
party
it
will
be
nice
.

The
clothes
now
that
they
will
wear
it
has
to
be
smart
,
not
how
you
are
going
to
casino
for
example
but
nice
casual
,
not
with
sports
shoes
or
T
-
shirts
.

On
the
last
day
in
the
afternoon
that
you
have
three
ours
free
you
can
go
for
coffee
or
to
visit
some
places
.

Those
are
my
ideas
for
the
conference
.

I
hope
that
you
will
like
it
.

Your
sincerely
,

Today
our
article
it
will
be
about
an
inventions
that
we
need
inour
life
.

I
think
that
all
this
things
we
need
in
our
life
because
it
can
give
us
a
lot
of
things
.

First
of
all
we
need
the
telephone
in
our
house
because
it
's
important
to
make
call
if
you
need
something
of
if
it
something
happend
to
your
house
and
nobody
is
next
to
you
.

The
second
one
is
the
lamp
,
the
electricity
that
is
very
important
in
our
life
.

In
the
past
the
people
did
n't
have
electicity
and
if
they
wanted
for
example
to
read
or
to
cook
something
they
used
to
do
in
the
fire
.

It
's
important
to
have
electricity
because
without
this
you
ca
n't
do
anything
.

The
other
one
is
the
television
.

You
must
have
TV
because
you
can
liten
what
it
happend
in
the
world
and
you
can
watch
some
places
that
you
did
n't
go
.

You
can
enjoy
you
time
to
watch
a
film
if
you
have
free
time
.

The
boat
it
's
not
so
important
but
you
can
use
it
for
fishing
and
to
see
some
places
.

The
car
now
is
very
important
in
our
life
you
can
go
wherever
you
want
.

In
this
year
the
familys
they
have
3
cars
in
one
family
one
by
one
person
.

For
me
the
most
important
thing
is
the
telephone
because
without
this
you
ca
n't
do
anything
,
it
's
part
of
my
life
.

Dear
Maria
Smith
,

First
of
all
,
the
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
a
big
hotel
because
there
will
be
a
lot
of
people
.

It
has
a
swimming
-
pool
and
a
nice
bar
.

The
hotel
is
ten
minutes
far
from
the
conference
and
there
will
be
a
bus
available
to
go
directly
over
there
.

At
the
end
of
the
conference
,
there
will
be
a
dinner
in
a
luxurious
restaurant
so
people
must
have
nice
clothes
;
jean
's
is
not
allowed
.

Next
to
the
restaurant
,
there
is
a
disco
for
people
who
like
dancing
.

We
can
do
a
lot
of
things
in
my
area
.

We
have
the
possibility
to
visit
the
old
town
,
it
's
very
nice
and
there
is
a
lot
of
shops
.

We
can
visit
the
old
castle
or
the
painting
museum
too
.

I
find
television
the
most
important
invention
.

I
think
it
's
good
for
old
people
because
some
of
them
can
not
go
to
the
cinema
anymore
.

In
one
hand
it
's
because
they
have
not
enough
money
to
pay
it
and
in
the
other
hand
it
's
because
they
ca
n't
move
very
well
for
example
if
they
are
disabled
.

With
television
,
old
people
are
less
alone
because
most
of
old
woman
have
not
her
husband
anymore
.

Television
is
a
good
way
to
be
informed
with
the
news
.

I
prefer
being
informed
by
television
than
by
newspapers
,
it
's
more
relaxing
.

I
think
television
is
a
good
invention
for
children
when
they
have
free
time
and
while
they
are
watching
television
,
we
do
n't
have
to
look
after
them
if
we
have
something
important
to
do
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
'm
very
glad
to
be
able
to
help
you
out
with
such
sutiation
.

First
of
all
,
the
group
has
been
booked
into
'
THE
PALACE
HOTEL
'
.

You
wo
n't
have
any
problem
to
find
the
college
because
it
's
in
front
of
the
Hotel
,
and
the
conference
will
be
there
.

As
you
know
,
the
conference
will
start
at
11:00
and
it
will
finish
at
13:00
,
but
we
will
have
lunch
altogether
at
13:30
in
the
college
's
hall
until
14:30
.

You
'll
have
to
wear
a
white
shirt
and
blue
trousers
,
if
you
want
you
will
be
able
to
wear
a
blue
jacket
.

When
we
had
finished
you
'll
be
able
to
enjoy
yourself
in
our
cinema
or
television
room
,
but
if
you
prefer
other
things
,
we
've
got
a
swimming
pool
and
a
library
,
it
will
your
own
choice
.

I
hope
it
was
useful
for
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Group
leader
,

In
order
of
your
request
,
I
'm
going
to
give
you
some
information
about
which
is
the
best
place
to
visit
in
this
town
,
Fuengirola
.

Fuengirola
has
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
castle
which
is
right
on
the
sea
front
.

It
is
placed
on
the
top
of
a
little
hill
which
is
part
of
the
beach
.

You
ca
n't
lose
the
chance
to
see
this
castle
because
it
is
an
excellent
view
and
always
there
are
a
lot
of
people
there
and
there
are
little
shops
where
you
can
buy
souvenirs
.

At
the
same
time
you
are
enjoying
the
castle
you
can
take
a
breake
to
go
to
the
beach
and
you
can
look
at
the
castle
from
the
sea
,
it
is
also
amazing
.

Also
,
there
is
a
museum
of
history
inside
.

As
you
see
,
you
have
to
visit
the
castle
,
you
wo
n't
feel
regret
about
that
.

Your
sincerley
,

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writting
to
answer
your
letter
where
you
asked
for
information
about
the
conferents
and
other
points
in
relation
with
.

The
hotel
where
your
group
has
been
booked
is
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
a
very
nice
hotel
in
the
centre
of
the
city
,
and
that
is
very
near
of
the
college
which
the
conference
is
into
,
five
minutes
walking
.

Going
walking
is
quicker
than
waiting
for
a
taxi
or
a
bus
.

When
you
arrive
to
the
Colleges
there
will
be
people
indicating
the
way
to
the
conference
room
.

At
the
end
of
the
conference
we
are
doing
a
party
with
some
cold
good
and
some
drinks
.

There
will
be
music
as
well
for
dancing
.

The
director
of
the
College
has
suggested
to
wear
smart
clothes
for
that
occasion
and
I
give
you
the
same
advice
.

About
the
afternoon
before
leaving
I
have
some
suggestions
.

In
the
area
of
the
Hotel
there
are
two
interesting
places
to
visit
.

One
is
the
Picasso
museum
and
the
other
is
an
important
Gallery
where
you
can
enjoy
seeing
differents
kinds
of
paintings
.

I
hope
my
information
can
help
you
and
it
has
been
useful
for
you
.

I
am
looking
forwards
to
see
you
at
the
Conference
.

Yours
sincerely
,

There
is
an
invention
that
I
think
that
has
been
very
important
:
the
computer
.

The
computer
is
very
useful
and
It
has
affect
our
own
lifes
,
in
differents
meanings
.

The
computer
has
done
easy
a
lot
of
works
.

For
works
that
you
needed
,
for
example
three
hours
you
can
do
them
in
ten
minutes
;
the
same
!

But
computers
do
n't
have
affected
only
in
a
good
way
because
thank
you
to
computers
the
number
the
places
of
work
for
the
persons
is
minor
.

But
,
definetely
they
has
been
a
very
important
invention
.

The
last
relationed
with
computers
is
internet
.

By
internet
you
can
comunicate
with
people
of
differents
places
of
the
world
at
the
same
moment
.

And
you
can
take
lots
of
informations
about
a
lot
of
things
.

Every
thing
that
you
need
you
can
find
it
in
internet
.

Nowadays
computer
are
very
developmented
and
it
is
increasing
.

What
will
be
the
next
?

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
have
received
your
letter
and
I
am
glad
I
can
help
you
.

You
have
been
booked
to
stay
in
the
Palace
Hotel
which
is
a
very
pleasant
hotel
not
far
away
from
here
.

The
best
way
to
get
here
is
;
once
you
have
gone
out
of
the
hotel
,
turn
right
,
then
follow
the
signs
to
the
hospital
,
because
it
is
just
by
our
college
.

When
you
are
in
the
college
ask
for
me
.

The
conference
will
take
one
hour
,
and
,
at
8
o'clock
the
party
will
start
,
it
is
a
formal
party
and
you
should
wear
formal
stuff
.

The
dress
code
is
:
no
jeans
.

We
will
prove
you
with
food
and
drinks
.

For
your
free
hours
I
have
quite
a
few
ideas
.

There
are
lots
of
things
to
do
here
.

We
have
got
a
museum
which
is
just
at
two
minutes
from
your
hotel
.

You
can
also
go
to
a
nearby
park
and
eat
something
in
the
café
.

If
you
go
to
the
main
street
you
will
find
a
street
full
of
shops
and
I
am
sure
the
students
would
like
that
.

I
hope
this
information
will
be
helpful
.

If
you
have
any
other
questions
,
please
,
do
contact
me
.

Looking
forward
to
seeing
you
soon
.

Your
sincerely
,

THE
MOBILE
PHONE

The
mobile
phone
has
completely
changed
our
lives
,
it
is
an
instrument
which
I
can
not
imagine
myself
living
without
.

Apart
from
being
in
-
fashion
it
is
also
a
very
helpful
machine
.

Do
you
remember
that
day
when
you
got
stuck
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
your
car
which
would
n't
work
?

What
would
you
have
done
in
that
moment
without
a
mobile
phone
?

You
were
at
home
in
less
than
ten
minutes
just
because
you
had
a
mobile
phone
with
you
,
amazing
,
is
n't
it
?

Nowadays
,
everyone
has
a
mobile
phone
.

I
am
fifteen
years
old
and
everybody
in
my
year
has
got
a
mobile
phone
.

Five
years
ago
you
would
n't
have
even
thought
about
it
.

It
has
been
a
plus
for
me
.

For
example
,
now
my
parents
allow
me
to
go
to
more
places
just
because
I
have
my
mobile
with
me
,
and
,
sending
text
messages
is
an
addiction
which
every
teenager
is
obsessed
with
.

All
over
,
the
invention
of
this
little
device
is
a
big
plus
for
everyone
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
to
inform
you
that
I
have
recieved
a
letter
from
you
about
helping
you
to
organise
an
international
student
conference
in
my
college
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
which
is
not
very
far
from
my
college
.

However
,
due
to
the
congestions
and
delay
near
the
hotel
,
the
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
by
underground
,
Victoria
Street
station
.

You
would
arrive
at
the
other
station
opposite
my
college
in
approximately
15
minutes
.

At
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
you
may
either
leave
the
party
or
stay
in
the
college
for
more
activities
.

All
different
types
of
clothing
could
be
worn
however
jean
wears
and
T
-
shirts
would
be
common
on
that
day
.

Instead
staying
in
the
hotel
for
the
last
three
hours
,
I
suggest
that
you
could
perhaps
visit
our
town
centre
.

The
popular
attractions
in
our
town
,
including
the
art
gallery
,
museum
,
aquarium
,
market
square
,
could
be
found
near
our
monument
of
our
town
,
the
Saltisy
Bridge
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
see
you
soon
.

Yours
sincerely
,

The
Little
Woods
shopping
mall

Location

The
Little
Woods
shopping
mall
is
an
idea
place
for
you
and
your
group
to
visit
.

It
is
located
very
close
to
the
town
centre
next
to
the
town
museum
.

It
can
be
accessed
by
the
nearby
train
station
.

Facilities

For
those
students
who
are
very
interested
in
shopping
,
clothes
shops
,
jewellery
,
stationary
,
book
shops
,
fashion
and
beauty
departments
and
many
more
are
availiable
.

For
those
who
want
something
more
exciting
and
advanturous
,
you
are
recommanded
to
visit
the
Fun
Fair
and
amusement
on
the
top
floor
of
the
building
.

Other
facilities
such
as
cinemas
,

,
large
department
stores
could

There
is
a
little
souvenir
shop
for
tourists
and
a
special
discount
for
tourists
from
aboard
to
enter
the
car
park
.

Conclusion

Not
only
the
tourist
information
centre
would
provide
the
information
you
might
need
,
you
could
also
visit
the
ICT
block
which
allows
you
to
access
onto
anything
you
want
to
know
from
the
computers
.

A
special
trip
could
also
be
organized
.

Dear
Marie
,

I
am
writting
in
connection
with
your
letter
bout
the
international
student
conference
.

I
appreciate
if
I
can
offer
you
my
help
.

I
would
like
to
give
you
necessary
details
,
which
can
help
you
to
organise
the
conference
.

Richard
Brown
booked
the
Palace
Hotel
for
the
students
,
which
is
a
very
comfortable

You
need
only
5
minutes
by
walking

catch

After
conference
we
are
planning
to
organise
a
big
party
with
barbecue

The
party
will
take
place
on
forest
close
to
camping
place
.

I
hope
we
will
have
a
nice
weather
.

Therefore
,
I
suggest
to
wear
some
casual
clothes
.

On
the
last
day
an
afternoon
if
you
have
some
free
time
I
would
recommend
you
to
visit
a
very
famous
exposition
of
Leonardo
Devinci
.

The
exposition
will
take
place
on
\"
Gribaldi
museum
\"
,
which
you
can
find
on
the
Crariden
street
N
5
.

You
will
never
regred
about
my
suggestion
.

If
you
need
more
information
let
me
knowe
.

Best
regards
,

Report
on
the
building
at
the
Berkeley
Square
.

In
order
to
prepare
this
report
I
visited
the
business
college
and
interviewed
some
students
,
I
asked
them
only
one
question
\"
Which
building
do
you
find
more
beautiful
and
more
interesting
in
our
city
?
\"

The
Students
,
who
were
questioned
said
that
there
are
a
lot
of
interesting
buildings
in
our
City
.

However
the
majority
of
people
point
out
one
a
very
old
building
,
which
you
can
find
at
Barkeley
Square
.

Most
of
the
Students
found
this
building
very
particular
,
because
it
reflects
our
history
,
tradition
and
culture
.

If
you
visit
the
building
,
you
will
get
impression
,
feeling
,
that
you
are
in
past
times
.

This
building
attracts
a
lot
of
people
,
-
because
it
has
a
very
particular
style
with
majestic
,
antique
windows
.

In
addition
,
I
also
visited
this
place
-
and
I
was
very
impressed
.

Finally
I
would
recommend
you
visited
Barkely
Square
area
.

In
this
area
you
could
also
find
another
different
buildings
,
which
would
you
attract
.

leader

from

12.06.01

Dear
Maria
,

I
've
recieved
your
letter
asking
me
for
further
information
about
the
conference
that
you
going
to
organise
very
soon
,
here
yo
have
a
little
help
for
it
.

At
first
,
I
'd
like
to
tell
you
that
the
hotel
where
you
going
to
stay
is
\"
The
Palace
Hotel
\"
,
wich
is
situated
at
the
center
of
the
town
.

It
ca
n't
be
difficult
to
find
,
because
is
very
near
of
the
conference
.

Also
there
is
a
bus
provided
for
the
organisation
to
take
all
the
students
at
the
hotel
.

At
the
end
of
the
conference
it
will
be
a
party
.

I
might
suggest
you
to
wear
a
casual
dress
,
because
many
students
feels
relaxing
after
the
whole
day
sitting
and
listening
all
the
conference
.

The
party
is
amazed
by
a
group
of
musicians
,
and
as
I
remembered
from
last
year
it
was
unforgiven
,
because
all
the
people
where
dancing
and
having
a
lot
of
fun
.

It
is
a
well
-
situated
town
with
a
lot
of
museums
to
visit
especially
\"
the
History
museum
\"
wich
I
visited
last
year
,
and
I
think
you
can
enjoy
as
well
.

It
does
n't
take
a
lot
of
time
to
visit
and
the
entrance
is
free
.

Whising
I
've
been
very
helpful
to
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

TELEPHONE
CHANGE
OUR
LIFES

It
's
imposible
Nowdays
to
think
a
life
without
that
invention
how
quickly
affects
our
life
especially
in
business
.

We
ca
n't
imagine
a
big
company
without
a
phone
,
that
can
makes
business
more
quickly
than
anything
else
.

Also
,
I
was
asking
too
many
people
in
the
street
.

Could
you
live
without
telephone
?

The
answer
was
all
the
same
\"
Imposible
\"
.

An
old
woman
told
me
how
important
was
the
phone
when
her
only
son
was
abroad
studing
computers
in
the
\"
Chicago
University
\"
,
she
told
me
that
every
night
was
expecting
a
call
from
her
son
,
for
her
was
the
line
of
the
hapiness
.

However
it
was
one
persone
wich
he
told
me
,
it
was
n't
happy
at
all
with
the
phone
,
because
he
used
to
writte
a
lot
,
especially
at
Christmas
to
wish
all
his
friends
a
very
nice
Christmas
but
now
everybody
phone
him
losing
a
very
old
fashion
.

In
my
opinion
this
little
\"
box
\"
that
everybody
has
at
home
can
safe
your
life
,
especially
if
you
need
to
ring
a
doctor
in
an
emergency
situation
.

In
conclusion
do
n't
make
a
very
long
phone
calls
and
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
very
expensive
bill
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

It
's
a
shame
that
I
wo
n't
see
Richard
because
of
his
illness
,
but
I
'm
willing
to
help
you
as
much
as
I
can
.

Then
I
will
give
you
some
information
which
you
asked
for
in
your
letter
.

Firstly
,
about
your
accomodation
,
our
college
which
I
belong
to
offers
visitor
free
accomodations
with
full
of
facilities
.

(
for
example
bath
,
car
park
,
free
internet
access
,
etc
.
)

They
also
are
located
in
our
campus
so
you
can
get
to
the
conference
by
walk
.

Secondly
,
as
you
know
we
'll
have
a
party
after
the
conference
,
which
will
be
taken
place
at
our
student
council
hall
with
some
meals
.

This
party
is
unlikely
to
be
that
formal
,
but
I
recommend
you
not
to
wear
jeans
and
trainners
.

At
last
,
if
you
have
free
time
for
couple
of
ours
,
you
'd
better
visit
Kamakura
City
,
which
is
30
minutes
from
our
campus
by
train
.

That
is
very
traditional
Japanese
city
where
so
many
temple
and
heritages
are
there
.

I
'm
sure
you
'll
enjoy
it
and
maybe
get
familier
with
our
culture
.

By
the
way
,
if
you
have
any
other
questions
,
please
send
me
a
letter
again
.

Oh
Baby
,
I
ca
n't
live
without
you
!

These
days
,
we
've
been
sorrounded
with
so
any
different
kinds
of
products
which
our
ancestors
invented
.

In
our
daily
life
,
however
,
we
seldom
notice
how
much
convinient
life
we
've
got
,
what
is
more
,
how
much
inconvinient
our
grandparents
had
got
.

How
nasty
we
are
!

Let
us
try
to
appreciate
thier
importance
again
.

As
for
me
,
the
invention
which
is
most
important
to
me
is
a
personal
computer
.
I
have
been
a
full
time
student
in
the
university
at
home
,
and
their
classes
all
requires
us
to
have
personal
computer
and
use
them
at
any
times
.

When
you
take
the
class
on
computer
programming
,
you
will
definetly
need
one
and
it
holds
true
for
the
class
on
politics
,
because
you
have
to
study
statistic
on
your
computer
for
doing
social
research
and
some
analysys
.

My
professor
said
'
go
and
get
familier
with
your
computer
,
otherwise
you
'll
fail
'
.

I
find
it
amazingly
easy
to
forget
the
importance
of
inventions
which
we
useually
use
without
any
questione
.

That
's
the
nature
of
human
being
.

But
,
I
think
it
's
not
only
our
fault
but
the
evidence
of
how
much
they
integrate
in
our
life
.

Dear
mrs
smith

your
letter

some
information

I

Computer
magic
.

Can
you
imagine
the
life
before
computer
.

Lots
of
books
,
papers
,
many
things
on
the
tabels
.

Computer
is
really
claver
machine
.

He

all
information
,
never
say
enough
and
it
never
forget
any
information
,
whenever

them
from
him
he
dosn't
refuse

He
saves
time
for
humankind
People
do
n't
need
to
spend
a
lot
time
to
record
everything
,
it
makes
space
in
offices
.

Many
bosses
or
in
the
factories
not
being
needed
to
employ
many
claver
workers
Because
we
do
n't
need
them
a
lot

This
saves
a
lot
money
for
companies

Because
in

we
can
use

the
extreemest
operation
easyly
and
confedantly
.

In
general
computer
has
brought
human
life
two
century
ahead
.
it
makes
life
easier
for
us
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
reply
to
your
letter
,
which
I
received
yesterday
.

Below
is
a
piece
of
information
you
will
need
for
the
next
international
student
conference
at
Bournemouth
College
and
some
recommendations
,
which
might
be
useful
for
the
students
.

First
of
all
,
the
hotel
booked
for
the
group
is
the
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
very
impressive
in
terms
of
comfort
and
facilities
.

This
is
a
very
central
hotel
located
not
far
away
from
the
conference
hall
.

You
will
be
able
to
get
there
either
by
bus
(
no
150
)
or
on
foot
.

Next
you
are
welcome
to
attend
the
party
organized
at
the
end
of
the
conference
.

It
will
begin
at
elevenish
p.m.
and
may
last
the
whole
night
.

People
are
going
to
be
disguised
there
and
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
wear
extravagant
multi
-
coloured
clothes
.

Finally
I
think
that
you
should
jump
at
opportunity
to
go
to
the
historical
Pergam
's
Museum
before
leaving
.

Some
of
the
most
amazing
masterpieces
are
exposed
there
.

I
wish
you
in
advance
a
wonderful
trip
and
look
forward
to
meeting
you
in
Bournemouth
.

Your
sincerely

To
:
(
group
leader
)

From
:

Subject
:
Bournemouth
National
Museum

As
requested
I
visited
the
Bournemouth
National
Museum
,
which
is
,
to
my
mind
,
one
of
the
most
interesting
buildings
of
the
area
.

Below
is
a
summary
of
the
most
important
relevant
points
and
some
recommendations
you
may
need
.

1
.
Architecture

The
architecture
of
the
building
in
itself
is
really
breathtaking
in
terms
of
luxury
and
ornamentation
choice
.

Even
if
the
architectural
style
may
seem
a
bit
'
heavy
,
this
building
is
really
a
masterpiece
with
no
similar
comparison
all
over
the
world
.

2
.
Exposition

Although
I
have
to
admit
that
it
is
very
tiring
to
visit
the
whole
museum
in
one
day
,
it
is
such
a
rewarding
and
enriching
time
that
people
get
never
tired
of
looking
at
the
paintings
and
sculptures
of
each
section
of
the
museum
.

3
.
Restaurant

The
adjoining
restaurant
is
very
enjoyable
as
well
.

The
waiters
are
friendly
and
always
ready
to
give
advice
.

In
fact
it
is
just
what
visitors
need
after
their
trip
through
the
museum
.

To
sum
up
,
I
would
say
that
this
museum
is
more
interesting
than
the
other
museums
,
because
you
can
enjoy
not
only
wonderful
masterpieces
but
also
a
very
uncommon
architecture
and
a
quiet
restaurant
to
have
a
rest
if
you
need
to
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

In
reply
to
your
letter
,
I
would
like
to
answer
your
questions
and
give
you
more
information
.

Firstly
,
the
hotel
in
which
the
group
is
going
to
stay
is
'
Palace
Hotel
'
.

Secondly
,
the
easiest
way
to
travel
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
is
by
a
local
bus
.

There
is
a
bus
stop
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
no.31
or
3
will
take
you
directly
to
the
conference
.

Thirdly
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
would
be
a
small
disco
,
with
a
variety
of
drinks
and
food
provided
.

Therefore
,
you
could
wear
something
quite
casual
.

Lastly
,
on
the
last
day
,
I
would
suggest
you
to
visit
the
Edinburgh
Castle
and
the
National
Scottish
Museum
,
as
both
of
them
are
very
interesting
and
have
the
student
discount
.

I
hope
this
letter
should
help
you
with
enough
information
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Could
modern
people
live
without
a
light
bulb
?

Well
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.

Only
people
who
could
live
without
it
,
must
be
extremely
weird
or
somebody
in
a
very
difficult
situation
!

We
are
nearly
always
surrounded
by
the
'
man
-
made
'
light
.

With
it
,
we
read
,
study
,
walk
,
and
so
on
.

In
the
past
people
relied
on
the
sunlight
,
moonlight
and
the
light
from
fire
.

These
were
,
however
,
very
unreliable
when
the
weather
was
bad
and
when
the
fuel
ran
out
.

They
had
to
read
,
study
and
walk
in
the
dark
.

Today
,
this
kind
of
thing
hardly
happens
!

Well
,
unless
there
was
n't
anything
wrong
with
the
power
supply
.

I
remember
when
I
was
about
5
,
I
visited
a
museum
with
my
family
.

While
I
was
in
toilet
,
all
the
light
was
turned
off
!

I
screamed
and
cried
since
I
'd
never
experienced
being
in
a
complete
darkness
before
.

When
the
light
was
turned
on
again
,
I
realised
how
important
even
a
single
light
bulb
would
be
,
and
I
was
sure
I
can
never
,
ever
live
without
it
.

Dear
Maria
,

First
of
all
,
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
Richard
is
ill
.

As
the
conference
must
go
on
,
I
will
give
you
the
information
you
asked
for
in
order
to
work
on
with
this
conference
.

According
to
the
hotel
,
the
group
has
been
arranged
to
stay
in
a
hotel
which
is
very
near
the
place
we
are
going
to
have
the
conference
.

The
hotel
is
The
Palace
Hotel
.

It'is
just
only
5
minutes
walk
from
there
to
the
conference
and
I
would
like
to
suggest
that
this
is
the
best
way
to
get
to
the
conference
.

About
the
party
,
we
will
have
a
party
at
the
end
of
the
conference
at
the
hotel
you
will
stay
.

The
party
will
be
in
a
friendly
atmosphere
so
do
n't
worry
about
what
to
wear
.

There
will
be
only
our
group
,
so
dress
whatever
you
want
and
enjoy
ourselves
.

Lastly
,
what
you
could
possibly
do
while
you
will
be
waiting
for
three
hours
,
for
some
people
who
want
to
go
shopping
.

The
shopping
centre
is
just
right
opposite
of
the
hotel
,
however
,
some
people
may
want
to
just
wait
at
the
hotel
,
having
a
cup
of
coffee
.

The
cafe
in
the
hotel
is
available
.

I
hope
that
information
will
be
useful
.

If
you
have
any
questions
I
am
more
than
happy
to
help
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
at
the
conference
.

Yours
sincerely
.

Could
you
live
without
this
?

Imagine
how
your
life
would
be
if
you
woke
up
one
morning
and
found
that
all
the
electricity
had
gone
.

How
would
you
manage
to
get
yourself
ready
to
go
to
work
.

How
would
you
know
what
happens
in
the
whole
wide
world
or
even
how
you
would
get
yourself
breakfast
without
toaster
!
!
!

How
would
you
cope
with
all
those
?

Thank
god
for
those
who
had
created
the
electricity
and
had
appliedapplied
it
into
every
appliances
.

The
electricity
is
a
clever
invention
.

Everything
bases
on
the
use
of
electricity
,
for
instance
from
a
little
bulb
light
to
the
most
complicated
computer
system
which
stored
priceless
information
!

Life
would
n't
be
easy
if
we
did
n't
have
electricity
.

The
electricity
is
very
important
in
keeping
our
lives
go
.

No
matter
where
you
are
,
what
you
do
,
apparantly
,
you
need
the
electricity
.

Let
's
think
this
way
,
if
we
did
n't
have
the
electricity
,
there
would
be
no
other
inventions
at
all
!
!

I
,
personally
,
could
n't
live
without
the
electricity
.

It
has
already
affected
and
play
a
great
role
in
my
life
.

I
watch
the
television
and
use
the
computer
everyday
.

Moreover
,
other
facilities
in
my
house
,
telephone
,
air
-
conditioner
,
fridge
,
for
example
,
they
are
all
need
the
electricity
.
That'is
why
it
is
very
important
to
my
life
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith

my
name
is
...
,
I
am
a
local
student
and
i
will
give
you
the
requested
information
.

The
rooms
for
your
students
have
been
booked
at
the
Palace
Hotel
near
the
city
-
centre
.

The
hotel
is
just
three
busstops
away
from
our
college
.

So
you
and
your
students
can
take
the
bus
from
the
central
busstation
that
is
right
in
front
of
your
hotel
to
get
to
the
conference
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
starts
just
one
our
after
the
end
of
the
conference
.

It
is
located
in
our
sports
hall
.

There
will
be
live
music
and
a
midnight
dinner
.

So
you
do
n't
have
to
appear
very
noble
dressed
,
just
as
you
like
it
(
there
is
no
order
-
you
may
wear
what
you
want
)
.

For
your
last
day
I
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
vistit
our
historical
and
famous
city
-
centre
.

I
will
organize
a
tourist
guide
to
give
us
information
about
the
old
buildings
and
sights
.

If
you
have
any
more
questions
write
me
a
short
letter
.

Yours
sincerely

The
invention
of
the
car
was
a
great
point
in
history
.

From
there
on
people
got
mobile
and
had
the
possibility
to
travel
wherever
they
wanted
.

Of
course
within
the
physical
barriers
.

People
now
had
the
chance
to
move
to
far
away
places
to
spend
their
leassure
time
,
to
relax
,
or
just
to
see
something
different
than
their
home
-
countryside
.

In
my
life
the
car
has
an
enormous
influence
.
I
come
from
a
rural
area
.

The
next
city
is
15
km
away
and
there
is
no
acceptable
bus
-
or
rail
connection
to
go
there
.

It
has
been
quiet
hard
to
me
not
to
have
the
opportunities
for
my
free
time
like
my
friends
that
lived
in
or
near
the
city
.

I
just
had
no
possibility
to
meet
them
after
school
,
because
I
had
no
vehicle
to
get
there
.

I
always
needed
my
Mom
or
my
Dad
to
take
me
where
I
wanted
to
go
.

Today
I
have
my
own
car
and
I
use
it
daily
to
get
to
work
and
to
meet
my
friends
at
any
place
and
any
time
.

So
with
my
car
I
achieved
a
great
freedom
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
applying
your
letter
where
you
asked
for
some
information
about
the
conference
in
Peterborough
Regional
College
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
which
is
situated
in
the
city
center
,
at
15
minutes
walking
from
where
the
conference
take
place
in
.

In
the
next
page
there
is
a
map
showing
you
the
best
way
to
get
to
the
conference
that
will
be
at
the
Regional
College
.

The
conference
will
start
at
7
p.m
,
the
same
day
we
expect
,
the
18th
of
June
.

Our
director
will
make
a
speech
afterwards
and
there
will
be
a
party
with
some
snacks
,
drinks
and
music
.

For
the
people
interested
in
,
there
will
be
also
an
amusement
karaoke
.

Everybody
should
wear
formal
clothes
,
at
least
,
a
little
bit
formal
.

No
jeans
and
tee
-
shirts
.

There
is
a
lot
of
places
you
can
visit
in
Peterborough
.

We
have
a
Cathedral
you
can
visit
anytime
and
the
river
side
,
which
is
the
best
if
it
is
a
nice
day
,
sunny
an
warm
,
for
take
a
walk
.

For
any
details

Yours
sincerely
,

Alice
knew
that
is
was
going
to
be
a
very
special
day
for
her
.

She
had
a
dream
where
somebody
told
her
that
that
day
would
be
special
.

So
,
she
took
the
bus
,
like
every
morning
,
and
she
went
to
school
.

But
that
day
was
a
little
bit
different
:
she
had
her
maths
exam
.

She
had
never
passed
an
maths
exam
and
she
was
really
nervous
.

Half
an
hour
before
the
exam
she
went
to
the
cafeteria
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
.

She
sat
down
and
what
a
surprise
she
found
a
lottery
ticket
.

Nobody
was
around
her
,
so
she
took
the
ticket
.

Drank
her
cup
of
tea
and
she
went

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
have
just
received
a
letter
from
you
.

I
am
really
appreciate
your
interesting
about
our
conference
.

Firstly
,
the
Palace
hotel
is
your
accommodation
which
you
have
booked
.

This
is
very
nice
hotel
and
I
am
sure
you
will
be
very
pleased
with
staying
there
.

Secondly
,
you
will
have
no
problems
finding
the
conference
.

Obviously
,
using
a
taxi
is
the
best
but
unfortunately
it
is
quite
expensive
for
student
.

However
,
we
have
already
prepared
a
mini
-
bus
for
you
.

The
bus
will
be
in
front
of
your
hotel
at
1
p.m.
and
it
will
take
you
to
the
conference
.

Thirdly
,
we
will
have
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
at
6
p.m.
You
can
have
dinner
with
wine
which
is
very
famous
in
our
area
and
also
you
can
enjoy
the
semi
-
classical
concert
which
we
have
prepared
for
3
months
.

But
I
hope
you
will
wear
formal
suit
and
dress
.

You
will
not
be
allowed
to
enter
this
party
unless
you
wear
casual
clothes
.

Lastly
,
you
do
not
have
any
problem
spending
your
extra
time
in
Cambridge
because
we
have
a
lot
of
attraction
.

Cambridge
bus
tour
,
for
example
,
will
be
very
nice
time
for
you
because
it
is
the
best
and
the
easiest
way
of
knowing
Cambridge
.

But
if
you
do
not
like
it
,
you
can
enjoy
City
centre
by
walking
tour
and
then
you
can
enjoy
going
punting
which
is
the
most
pleasant
attraction
in
Cambridge
.

I
hope
you
will
be
happy
with
our
conference
and
party
and
etc
.

We
have
prepared
all
of
them
for
a
long

you

Therefore
,
you
had
better
wear
casual
and
comfortable
clothes
.

Finally
,
this
area
has
its
reputation
for
shopping
centres
,
so
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
buy
some
clothes
,
local
food
,
and
so
on
.

You
will
be
able
to
buy
them
in
reasonable
price
.

I
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
stay
in
my
country
.

I
look
forward
to
meeting
all
of
you
.

Yours

Amusement
Centre

Introduction

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
give
information
on
the
Amusement
Centre
in
Seoul
.

It
is
based
on
my
experience
and
on
views
expressed
by
local
people
who
were
interviewed
.

Facilities

It
was
found
that
the
Amusement
Centre
is
the
most
popular
building
in
Seoul
to
enjoy
yourself
.

There
is
a
wide
range
of
facilities
including
theatres
,
game
centres
,
Korean
restaurants
.

In
particular
,
the
people
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
theatres
,
because
the
screen
is
massive
.

The
Korean
restaurants
appeared
to
be
the
most
popular
to
foreigners
.

Things
to
buy

It
seemed
you
can
buy
everything
you
want
in
reasonable
price
in
the
building
.

Especailly
,
Korean
souvenir
shops
were
felt
to
be
extremely
cheap
.

However
,
you
can
buy
luxurious
things
as
well
if
you
wish
.

Conclusion

In
short
,
the
Amusement
Centre
is
fascinating
place
and
it
deserves
a
visit
.

I
would
highly
recommend
this
building
,
because
not
only
you
can
enjoy
yourself
but
also
experience
Korean
culture
which
might
be
exotic
to
foreign
visitors
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith

Thank
you
very
much
for
your
letter
,
which
I
received
yesterday
.

I
am
sure
,
together
we
can
spent
a
good
student
conference
in
my
college
.

I
will
give
you
now
some
useful
information
.

First
of
all
,
we
come
to
some
important
points
for
the
organisation
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
a
comfortabel
and
well
situatet
hotel
,
whose
name
is
,
,
Palace
Hotel
\"
.

The
hotel
is
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
Parker
Piece
,
which
you
can
find
on
the
map
,
which
I
will
send
you
.

The
,
,
Palace
Hotel
\"
is
5
minutes
walking
from
the
station
.

The
conference
is
situatet
in
the
building
opposite
the
bus
stop
.

After
a
short
speech
from
our
director
,
the
evening
entertainment
will
be
begin
.

In
a
well
know
and
enjoyable
pub
in
the
city
centre
we
consume
same
food
and
drinks
.

Furthermore
there
will
be
a
very
famous
life
band
.

You
do
not
have
to
wear
some
speciall
clothes
.

You
asked
me
for
some
suggestions
for
your
free
afternoon
.

Naturally
we
have
a
lot
of
interesting
things
to
visit
but
some
thing
specially
is
our
cathedrale
.

The
architecture
bring
you
back
into
the
old
time
.
as
well
as
the
stained
glass
windows
which
are
really
amazing
.

We
have
also
an
interesting
museum
and
a
modern
theatre
.

Finally
,
I
am
sure
you
and
your
group
will
spent
some
funny
realaxing
days
.

Please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
for
some
more
information
.

I
look
forward
to
meeting
each
other
soon
.

Yours
sincerely
.

Inventions
have
affected
all
our
lives
!

What
is
it
what
we
use
every
day
many
hours
?

Sometime
's
early
in
the
morning
until
late
in
the
evening
.

Yes
it
is
the
TV
.

It
is
well
know
in
almost
all
family
,
often
with
a
lot
of
different
cannels
.

First
of
all
,
the
TV
can
tell
us
news
in
a
short
time
,
what
happened
all
over
the
world
.

Another
point
in
favour
of
the
invention
for
the
TV
is
,
that
they
telling
about
interesting
reports
,
for
instance
about
animals
or
different
culture
from
other
countrys
.

Furthermore
they
have
a
lot
of
different
programme
,
usually
something
for
everybody
.

It
could
be
also
relaxing
to
sit
on
the
sofa
after
a
busy
day
at
work
.

Finally
,
the
TV
is
in
my
opinion
very
useful
for
getting
important
information
,
you
can
watching
the
weather
and
all
of
them
were
present
in
wonderful
colour
.

To
sum
up
,
in
my
opinion
the
TV
is
a
very
good
and
useful
invention
.

However
,
they
send
a
lot
of
violence
which
is
not
good
for
the
children
.

I
can
not
imagine
to
live
without
televison
,
it
is
something
what
we
need
for
our
education
,
for
getting
news
and
other
helpful
information
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

Surely
I
'll
try
to
help
you
as
good
as
I
can
.

First
,
I
tell
you
the
name
of
the
hotel
,
it
's
the
Palace
Hotel
.

Fortunately
,
it
is
not
far
from
our
college
.

For
getting
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
,
you
only
have
to
take
bus
no.7
and
get
off
at
St.
James
College
,
where
the
conference
will
take
place
.

About
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
I
can
only
say
that
a
band
will
be
playing
the
whole
night
,
and
a
special
guest
I
still
do
n't
know
will
be
expected
.

I
suggest
to
wear
casual
clothes
,
I
think
there
's
no
need
of
school
uniforms
.

To
answer
your
last
question
,
I
would
propose
you
to
attend
the
local
zoo
,
because
many
baby
animals
were
born
in
the
past
few
days
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,
I
hope
the
given
information
is
useful
for
you
.

I
'm
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
at
the
conference
.

Yours
sincerely
,

The
telephone

Could
you
imagine
there
's
no
telephone
ringing
in
an
office
?

Or
to
live
your
live
without
chatting
for
hours
with
your
best
friend
?

Could
you
?

I
ca
n't
!

The
telephone
was
invented
by
Alexander
Graham
Bell
in
the
end
of
the
19th
century
.

It
was
an
invention
nobody
thought
how
important
and
how
widespread
it
would
be
in
future
.

Nowadays
almost
every
household
in
the
western
world
owns
a
telephone
,
and
calling
to
relatives
or
friends
spread
all
over
the
world
is
no
strange
thing
.

People
need
the
telephone
not
only
for
chatting
,
but
also
for
exchanging
information
in
a
very
short
and
direct
way
with
the
possibility
to
answer
immediately
.

When
I
was
a
child
,
we
had
no
telephone
at
home
,
and
I
always
had
to
go
to
a
phone
box
in
the
centre
of
our
village
.

Now
I
have
my
own
flat
,
and
the
first
piece
of
furniture
I
've
bought
was
the
telephone
.
I
'll
never
take
it
away
from
my
home
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
want
to
inform
you
that
I
had
already
talked
to
Richard
Brown
and
he
informed
me
about
the
conference
.

Next
week
I
will
be
start
organising
some
events
for
this
conference
.

The
event
will
organize
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

The
same
hotel
that
will
you
stay
.

Palace
Hotel
is
opposite
the
park
'
Clifton
'
,
which
is
near
the
college
.

We
chose
that
hotel
because
is
it
near
the
college
and
we
do
n't
need
to
use
a
transport
.

Because
you
know
where
is
the
college
and
you
need
to
bring
with
me
some
things
at
the
college
to
hotel
I
think
that
is
better
to
come
all
the
group
in
college
and
then
we
can
go
all
together
to
the
'
Palace
Hotel
'
.

The
conference
start
at
9:00
o'clock
you
need
to
be
at
the
college
half
an
hour
before
.

Concerning
the
end
-
of
-
conference
I
'm
thinking
about
some
dance
and
singing
events
.

Tell
me
your
idea
.

About
the
clothes
that
we
need
to
wear
,
must
be
uniform
,
because
is
the
best
conference
to
London
and
every
year
are
coming
lectures
from
other
colleges
.

Finally
on
the
last
day
we
have
organised
a
seeing
-
crossing
around
London
.
You
will
have
the
opportunity
visiting
some
museums
and
zoo
parks
.

I
think
it
is
a
nice
idea
.

If
you
want
more
information
you
can
call
me
my
telephone
number
is
047***.
Please
if
you
have
more
ideas
send
me
a
letter
.

Yours
Sincerely
,

Nowdays
all
the
people
have
a
telephone
.

Telephone
is
part
of
our
life
.

It
is
one
of
the
most
important
investigation
all
over
the
world
.

Telephone
is
type
of
communication
.

If
you
want
to
talk
with
your
friends
,
parents
,
partner
or
to
ask
something
,
you
can
call
them
without
wondering
how
can
be
communicate
with
them
.

Especial
if
some
of
your
relatives
or
friends
are
living
in
other
country
you
can
communicate
with
them
and
everyday
and
you
do
n't
feel
that
they
are
far
a
way
from
you
.

Today
with
the
development
of
technology
has
been
improved
and
the
abilities
of
the
telephone
.

They
are
telephones
that
you
have
the
opportunity
to
talk
with
more
than
one
people
at
the
line
.

Also
you
can
leave
a
message
if
you
call
and
ca
n't
find
someone
.

The
last
type
of
telephone
,
is
the
mobile
phone
.

You
can
use
it
everywhere
and
at
anytime
.

Finally
telephone
except|apart
from
type
of
communication
,
is
type
and
socialisation
.

Nowadays
who
are
so
bussy
and
we
do
n't
have
free
time
to
see
our
friends
,
we
can
call
them
and
talk
or
chat
with
them
.

Especial
the
young
people
are
using
many
hours
the
telephone
and
that
is
trouble
for
their
parents
.

Telephone
is
very
important
investigation
if
we
can
use
it
correct
without
use
it
as
type
of
entertaiment
as
they
are
doing
nowadys
many
people
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith

I
have
received
your
letter
,
which
was
about
that
you
would
like
me
to
inform
you
.

As
you
know
,
a
hotel
whose
name
is
Palace
Hotel
has
been
booked
for
your
group
.

The
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
to
take
a
taxi
.

I
am
afraid
there
are
no
buses
to
get
there
.

We
will
have
a
great
party
at
the
end
of
the
conference
.

The
party
will
be
formal
,
therefore
you
have
to
wear
formal
clothes
like
a
suit
or
a
dress
.

As
you
know
,
it
is
not
suitable
to
wear
a
jean
or
something
.

On
your
last
day
you
have
an
afternoon
free
.

In
my
area
there
is
a
fantastic
park
,
which
is
the
most
famous
park
in
the
country
.

You
can
find
a
lot
of
things
to
do
or
to
see
.

You
can
visit
the
zoo
or
walk
around
the
amazing
lake
in
the
park
.

I
hope
you
will
find
all
the
details
,
which
you
would
like
to
have
in
the
letter
.

If
you
need
any
information
,
please
let
me
know
.

Your
Sincerely
,

Power
Of
Computurs
.

How
much
can
a
computer
affect
your
life
?
I
think
it
effects
more
than
you
think
.

When
I
was
a
child
I
always
wanted
to
get
the
lyrics
of
the
songs
that
I
liked
,
but
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
have
them
.

I
felt
lack
of
them
.

I
first
bought
a
computer
as
I
was
in
university
.

It
was
so
necessary
for
me
because
I
wanted
to
be
a
computer
programmer
.

That
time
I
met
the
magic
world
of
computers
.

Linking
to
the
internet
was
so
popular
.

Internet
was
something
amazing
for
me
.

Can
you
think
you
have
every
information
you
need
whenever
you
want
?

Can
you
think
you
contact
with
anyone
who
is
from
any
country
whenever
you
want
?

I
meet
a
lot
of
people
on
internet
and
it
really
interest
me
.

I
learn
a
lot
about
their
culture
by
speaking
them
on
internet
.

I
was
n't
able
to
imagine
this
before
.

In
addition
this
,
today
companies
can
do
nothing
without
a
computer
.

Everything
in
this
world
works
with
computers
from
now
on
.

Computers
changed
my
life
style
,
my
opinion
about
the
world
.

And
they
effect
everyone
's
life
directly
or
indirectly
.

Dear
Mrs
M.
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
order
to
reply
to
your
letter
and
to
give
you
all
the
information
that
you
requested
.

First
of
all
the
hotel
is
the
Palace
Hotel
,
82
Regent
Street
,
so
that
it
is
very
easy
to
reach
the
conference
.

In
fact
you
can
take
the
bus
number
3
;
as
you
can
see
,
the
bus
stop
is
just
in
front
of
the
hotel
,
then
you
can
get
off
immediately
after
the
church
that
you
pass
,
on
your
right
hand
.

Secondly
,
we
will
have
the
party
in
the
hotel
at
8.00
o'clock
and
a
buffet
will
be
served
at
8.30
p.m.
It
would
be
also
possible
to
get
some
vegetarian
food
and
drink
cocktails
free
of
charge
.
I
would
recommend
your
students
to
bring
their
Identity
Card
to
prove
their
age
.

What
is
more
,
I
would
suggest
to
wear
very
smart
dress
and
for
men
it
is
oblidged
the
tie
.

Finally
,
if
I
were
you
I
would
go
shopping
to
the
City
Centre
to
spend
your
last
hours
.

However
,
if
you
re
interested
in
Archeology
you
should
vitis
the
History
Museum
in
Garden
Square
.

I
hope
you
will
find
my
letter
of
interest
and
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

Yours
Sincerely
,

Have
you
ever
thought
to
live
without
your
car
?

How
can
you
manage
your
daily
life
without
it
?

I
the
last
fourty
years
people
seem
to
be
completely
addicted
by
using
their
own
car
.

It
is
said
that
the
majority
of
the
citizens
has
got
a
car
and
unfortunately
this
is
the
reason
why
cities
are
getting
more
polluted
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
kind
of
facility
has
made
our
life
more
comfortable
and
easy
.

In
fact
we
can
go
everywhere
sitting
either
with
friends
or
with
our
family
and
carring
lugguage
and
shopping
bags
.

Cars
are
able
to
cover
not
only
short
distance
but
also
can
be
used
for
long
journey
.

For
example
,
in
the
past
it
would
had
been
extremely
exhausting
travelling
riding
a
hourse
but
nowadays
we
have
lots
of
big
and
spacious
cars
and
a
wide
range
of
optionals
to
choose
with
.

However
,
I
have
to
say
that
it
has
made
people
be
lazy
and
at
the
same
time
stressed
due
to
the
traffic
.

On
the
other
hand
one
of
the
main
advantages
is
that
we
can
save
time
and
money
as
cars
have
long
last
and
allowe
us
travelling
quickly
.

That
's
why
I
could
n't
image
my
life
without
it
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
which
I
received
last
week
.

If
student
is
ill
,
we
will
return
the
money
but
you
should
tell
us
untill
one
week
before
we
start
.

And
you
are
staying
the
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
located
in
town
Centre
.

You
can
take
buses
or
our
school
buses
.

It
costs
forty
pence
.

If
you
take
public
buses
,
it
costs
more
expensive
than
school
bus
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
going
to
start
from
Seven
o'clock
.

One
of
our
teacher
,
who
will
be
voted
by
student
is
making
speech
for
one
hour
.

After
,
student
is
making
speech
about
what
he
or
she
have
learned
.
and
diner
.

In
my
opinion
,
you
should
wear
normal
cloth
.

I
would
like
to
suggest
that
you
should
visit
building
of
sixty
two
which
is
consisted
on
sixty
second
floor
.

There
are
eye
-
max
cinema
,
museums
,
garelty
.

This
is
very
famous
in
our
city
.

I
hope
that
my
advice
will
help
you
.

I
look
forward
to
hearing
soon
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith

With
reference
to
your
letter
which
I
recived
yesterday
,
I
would
like
to
give
you
some
details
about
The
international
student
conference
,
also
the
acomodation
and
activities
that
are
planed
during
this
week
.

The
Hotel
that
is
booked
for
the
students
it
is
one
of
the
beast
in
the
area
,
it
has
great
facilities
and
it
is
situated
near
to
the
place
where
the
conference
is
going
to
be
.

The
best
way
to
get
there
from
The
hotel
is
by
bus
and
it
is
already
booked
for
the
next
day
you
arrive
,
at
8:30
am
.

About
the
party
which
is
just
at
the
end
of
the
conference
,
a
good
it
would
be
a
dance
party
and
the
students
do
n't
really
need
to
wear
special
clothes
,
it
's
just
to
have
a
little
dance
and
meet
all
the
students
,
after
the
party
there
is
a
small
trip
to
the
old
part
of
the
city
and
I
think
it
would
be
a
good
choice
to
spend
the
last
three
hours
that
you
have
left
before
go
back
.

I
hope
this
letter
aswer
all
your
questions

it

give
me
a
call
or
send
me
a

your

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
give
some
information
about
The
new
Acapulco
resart
buildings
which
was
build
10
years
ago
and
it
is
one
of
the
first
buildings
that
was
build
with
the
latest
tecnonology
and
made
by
a
important
Mexican
arquitector
.

In
addition
the
resort
has
an
interesting
History
background
about
arquitectory
and
the
best
facilities
and
activities
that
you
could
have
in
Mexico
for
example
,
it
provides
differents
kinds
of
tours
around
Mexico
.

On
the
contrary
it
is
far
away
from
the
city
and
it
has
difficult
transport
facilities
.

In
spite
of
the
disadvantages
,
I
would
strongly
recomended
to
students
and
public
to
visit
the
new
Acapulco
resort
buildings
.
and
have
a
great
experience
knowing
about
buildings
history
and
at
the
same
time
traveling
around
Mexico
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
am
afraid
to
hear
that
Mr.
Brown
is
ill
I
hope
it
wo
n't
be
grave
.

However
,
I
will
be
glad
to
give
you
as
much
information
as
you
need
and
I
hope
you
will
find
it
helpful
.

the
name
of
the
hotel
in
which
the
group
is
going
to
stay
in
is
Palace
Hotel
,
to
get
there
you
must
go
to
the
centre
of
town
,
all
buses
are
going
there
,
Once
you
are
in
the
centre
Palace
Hotel
is
right
in
front
of
the
tourism
information
office
.

For
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
we
have
booked
one
of
the
halls
of
the
hotel
and
they
will
provide
us
life
music
and
cattering
.

Due
the
hotel
is
such
an
elegant
place
I
would
suggest
to
dress
up
in
night
clothes
.

Finally
,
to
fill
your
free
afternoon
I
would
hardly
recomend
to
visit
the
cathedral
and
have
a
walk
arround
the
old
part
of
the
city
,
if
you
like
it
will
be
my
pleasure
to
show
you
the
souroundings
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Chairs
are
not
only
part
of
the
forniture
,
they
are
also
objects
of
decoration
and
you
can
even
find
some
in
museums
as
art
symbols
.

Who
could
have
invented
such
a
useful
item
?

In
fact
,
nobody
has
got
this
clue
,
but
it
must
have
been
the
most
clever
person
on
earth
!

the
world
is
packed
with
so
many
tipes
of
chairs
,
from
the
common
woden
ones
to
the
most
sophisticate
and
comfortables
others
finding
a
baste
range
of
prices
.

From
my
point
of
view
the
chair
is
without
a
doubt
the
most
usefull
gadget
ever
invented
.

Some
people
use
them
in
their
work
,
others
are
wishing
to
get
one
by
the
end
of
the
day
and
for
some
other
people
a
while
chair
represents
the
possibility
of
mouvement
.

Although
is
worth
to
say
that
not
everybody
can
chose
his
ideal
chair
there
is
a
special
one
for
each
of
us
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
am
glad
to
help
you
for
the
organisation
of
the
conference
.

I
phoned
to
the
tourist
information
last
week
and
I
got
some
information
about
the
accomodation
of
the
students
.

I
think
we
should
book
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
an
outstanding
building
situated
in
the
city
centre
.

The
Hotel
is
in
a
good
position
,
10
minutes
walk
from
the
conference
and
I
think
the
best
way
to
reach
it
is
on
foot
.

I
am
sure
the
students
will
enjoy
walking
in
the
streets
of
the
town
.

The
conference
starts
at
5
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
finishes
at
7
pm
.

I
think
they
should
wear
smart
dress
,
because
there
will
be
lots
of
interesting
people
and
important
meeting
.

In
conclusion
,
for
the
last
day
,
I
thought
it
will
be
very
interesting
for
the
students
to
visit
the
town
and
appreciate
its
monuments
and
art
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
prefer
to
have
a
relaxing
day
,
you
could
have
a
pic
-
nic
in
the
wonderful
park
.

I
hope
my
suggestion
and
Idea
will
help
you
to
organise
the
meeting
.

I
look
forward
to
receiving
your
confirmation
.

Yours
,

REPORT
:

TO
:
MR

FROM
:

DATE
:
21ST
JUNE
2000

INTRODUCTION
:

As
requested
,
the
aim
of
this
report
is
to
assess
the
suitbility
for
a
group
of
American
students
for
the
visit
at
the
Etruscan
Museum
.

GENERAL
INFORMATION
:

The
museum
is
situated
in
the
centre
of
Populoniou
,
the
picturesque
fishing
village
on
the
Etruscan
Coast
.

Populoniou
is
about
15
Km
.
from
Piombino
and
it
can
be
reached
by
well
-
organised
means
of
transport
.

DESCRIPTION
:

The
Etruscan
Museum
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
building
in
my
town
.

It
contains
lots
of
archeological
Etruscans
founded
and
some
remains
about
Etruscans
neoropolis
.

The
entrance
fee
is
£
7
each
student
.

POSITIVE
ASPECTS

1
.
The
Museum
is
well
-
organised
for
tourists
.

There
are
some
shops
,
café
and
toilets
.

Also
there
are
some
free
handphones
,
that
explain
the
history
of
the
museum
.

2
.

After
their
visit
into
the
Museum
,
they
could
enjoy
the
superb
view
of
the
sea
and
the
tuscan
Archipelago
,
and
they
could
have
a
pic
-
nic
on
the
beach
.

NEGATIVE
ASPECTS

1
.

The
negative
aspect
of
the
museum
is
that
is
quite
expensive
for
students
.

CONCLUSION
:

Although
the
entrance
fee
is
quite
expensive
for
a
group
of
students
,
I
strongly
reccomend
it
for
their
excursion
and
their
interests
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
am
writing
to
give
you
some
information
asked
in
your
letter
,
which
I
received
this
morning
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
in
Palace
Hotel
which
is
one
of
the
most
comfortable
hotels
in
London
.

Personally
,
I
am
glad
that
you
will
have
this
opportunity
to
use
its
various
facilities
.

It
is
based
in
the
city
centre
and
is
about
half
an
hour
by
underground
from
the
conference
.

In
my
oppinion
the
easiest
way
to
get
there
from
the
conference
would
be
by
taking
the
Picadelly
line
.

However
you
would
take
bus
number
150
,
if
you
would
like
to
have
a
look
at
the
city
centre
and
you
have
some
free
time
also
.

Regarding
to
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
I
would
suggest
to
wear
some
dress
for
a
woman
and
an
elegant
suit
for
a
man
,
though
,
it
is
no
formal
do
.

The
party
will
finish
quite
late
so
we
've
decided
to
provide
a
bus
which
would
take
you
to
the
hotel
safely
.

Basicaly
,
during
three
hour
time
in
the
afternoon
nobody
is
able
to
visit
all
of
interesting
places
of
London
.

However
you
would
have
a
long
walk
along
the
river
to
take
some
essential
photos
.

I
look
forward
to
welcoming
you
.

Yours
sincerely

Are
you
always
happy
when
your
telephon
ring
?

As
far
as
I
am
concerned
the
telephone
was
invented
in
19th
century
.

It
has
been
affecting
our
lifes
very
quickly
,
although
there
were
some
different
ways
of
communication
as
TV
,
for
instance
.

Since
the
internet
was
introduced
,
many
of
us
would
n't
have
imagined
the
lifes
without
this
.

We
were
able
even
to
have
our
own
telephone
kept
in
our
pocket
for
a
some
time
.

However
,
are
you
always
happy
when
your
personal
phone
rings
.

On
the
other
hand
I
wonder
whether
you
have
experienced
some
situations
when
you
would
n't
have
your
mobile
switched
on
.

This
invention
has
affected
my
life
completely
.

Since
I
have
been
traveling
around
the
world
I
would
have
imagined
beeing
in
tough
with
my
family
or
friends
without
internet
or
my
mobile
phone
.

In
spite
of
having
the
opportunity
of
keeping
contact
with
friends
at
the
time
we
are
far
away
from
home
,
we
should
have
been
knowledge
how
to
use
it
without
interrupting
others
.

Dear
Maria
:

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
will
be
pleasure
to
help
you
.

The
following
are
some
information
about
the
International
student
conference
.

The
party
will
be
take
place
in
Palace
Hotel
.

The
Hotel
is
very
close
Town
Hall
.

From
park
square
,
just
go
straight
.

You
can
see
the
sign

Report
building
of
LUTON
University

I
heard
that
a
group
of
America
students
has
just
arrived
in
our
town
.

I
want
to
introduce
an
interesting
building
for
them
to
visit
.

It
is
main
building
of
LUTON
University
at
park
square
.

There
is
a
academic
building
.

It
inculds
labrary
.

II
suit
,
academic
rooms
a
GYM
Club
and
a
restuarant
.

There
is
a
very
big
labrary
.

You
can
find
any
information
from
it
what
you
want
.

At
the
rest
of
time
,
you
can
go
to
IT
suit
use
Internet
.

If
you
feel
hungry
,
you
do
n't
need
go
out
.

Just
at
the
same
building
,
you
could
find
restuarant
.

I
recommen
this
buiding
to
visit
.

Because
American
students
will
know
British
students
is
how
to
study
and
different
campus
life
.

They
can
also
talk
with
British
students
to
communiate
study
experience
.

I
think
it
will
be
interesting
.
for
American
students
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
with
reference
on
your
letter
concerning
an
organization
of
an
international
student
conference
in
Wimbledon
Art
College
.

Below
I
am
clarifying
some
information
you
asked
about
.

First
of
all
,
I
would
like
to
give
you
more
information
about
name
and
location
of
the
hotel
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
\"
Maria
Luisa
\"
hotel
which
is
situated
on
the
center
of
Wimbledon
called
Wimbledon
Village
.

This
hotel
is
the
next
building
after
Art
College
,
so
it
will
be
easy
for
your
group
to
find
the
place
.

Secondly
turning
to
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
it
is
planed
to
be
in
Wimbledon
Common
-
nice
piece
of
England
nature
.

So
,
it
may
be
a
good
idea
to
take
some
very
comfortable
and
informal
clothes
.

Thirdly
,
talking
about
your
free
afternoon
before
leaving
the
area
,
I

Report
.

Introduction
:

The
purpose
of
this
report
is
to
give
a
brief
discription
of
the
Academy
of
Art
in
St
.-
Petersburg
.

From
my
point
of
view
this
building
is
the
best
option
to
visit
.

Location
:

This
building
is
situated
on
the
magnificent
embankment
of
Niva
River
with
an
exellent
view
on
the
Hermitage
Museum
.

History
:

The
building
was
built
by
very
famious
Russian
architect
and
is
a
marvellouse
example
of
Russian
classic
architerture
of
XVIIIth
century
.

Facilities
:

In
the
Academy
of
Art
you
can
find
the
oldiest
art
libarary
with
a
wide
range
of
books
,
the
Museum
of
Russian
Art
with
a
huge
collection
of
painting
,
sculpture
and
architectural
projects
from
early
eighteenth
to
late
twentieth
centuries
.

It
is
also
a
good
chance
to
be
introduced
with
Russian
system
of
art
education
.

Conclusion
:

The
building
of
Academy
of
Art
in
St
.-
Petersburg
is
worth
visiting
and
interesting
as
historical
as
educational
aspects
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
:

I
have
received
your
letter
which
informs
me
you
are
now
in
charge
of
the
group
of
students
attending
the
international
conference
.

It
is
my
pleasure
to
help
you
with
the
information
you
need
.

Your
group
has
been
booked
into
The
Palace
Hotel
,
located
on
the
High
street
,
opposite
to
the
Post
Office
.

The
conference
will
be
hold
in
The
Royal
Hall
,
and
the
best
way
to
get
there
from
the
hotel
is
by
bus
.

Take
the
67
route
and
it
will
take
you
just
in
front
of
The
Royal
Hall
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
be
hold
in
Francescos
Restaurant
,
just
by
The
Royal
Hall
.

You
should
wear
casual
clothes
.

About
what
you
can
do
in
the
area
for
the
free
time
you
have
,
I
would
suggest
you
to
visit
The
Modern
Art
Museum
which
has
now
a
new
exhibition
.

Another
suggestion
could
be
to
visit
the
zoo
,
or
just
walk
through
the
Spring
Gardens
which
are
beautiful
in
this
time
of
the
year
.

I
hope
all
this
information
is
helpful
for
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

The
Telephone
:
A
great
invention
.

Imagine
your
life
without
a
telephone
.

Yes
,
I
know
,
it
is
just
hard
to
imagine
our
lives
without
this
invention
.

Think
about
the
people
living
in
the
time
it
was
invented
.

Must
had
been
such
a
exciting
thing
being
able
to
talk
to
someone
living
thousands
of
miles
for
........
and
now
for
us
is
just
as
simple
as
dial
a
number
and
talk
to
whoever
we
want
to
.

Of
course
is
nice
to
have
a
phone
conversation
with
friends
or
family
,
but
the
telephone
is
also
very
important
for
business
and
emergencies
.

For
example
,
I
work
for
a
bank
,
and
we
need
to
have
weekly
meetings
with
our
Director
living
800
kilometers
far
,
and
he
does
n't
have
to
come
here
,
we
just
have
a
phone
conference
where
everybody
can
talks
,
and
that
is
it
!

What
about
emergencies
?

A
phone
call
in
time
for
an
ambulance
can
save
the
life
of
many
people
having
a
heart
attack
.

We
sometimes
do
n't
realize
the
importance
of
some
inventions
we
use
in
our
everyday
life
.

But
think
....
,
what
would
we
do
without
them
!

Dear
Mrs
Maria
.

I
am
one
of
all
students
and
I
am
going
to
give
you
an
information
,
all
you
need
.

We
have
been
booked
the
hotel
for
you
and
the
name
of
hotel
is
\"
Palace
Hotel
\"
quite
near
shopping
centre
.

It
is
not
far
aways
,
you
just
go
along
Park
Road
about
ten
minutes
.

Then
you
will
arrive
at
Palace
Hotel
on
the
left
handside
of
you
.

About
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

We
are
going
to
have
a
dinner
before
the
end
and
at
the
end
we
are
going
to
bring
you
to
the
Hotel
,
you
need
to
wear
a
night
-
dress
or
suit
and
bow
tie
.

Finally
,
on
the
last
day
you
have
three
hours
before
you
catch
the
plane
so
we
suggestion
,
you
can
go
to
shopping
centre
and
buy
something
for
your
special
person
or
go
to
museam
because
this
museam
is
the
biggest
in
the
world
now

sincerely

To
group
leader

I

leader
.
We
are
greatful
that
your
group
has
just
arrived
so
I
am
going
to
give
information
about
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

We
recommend
you
to
go
to
BBC
building
.

First
of
all
,
about
BBC
building
is
the
news
building
of
England
.

On
the
ground
floor
,
they
have
a
video
camera
everywhere
around
the
building
and
police
officer

receipt
the

CANADA
.

And
the
second
floor
is
the
news
room
where
they
get
on

not
finish
,
I
just
give

some
information
but
they
have
more
interesting
thing
you
do
not
know
.

I
recommend
you
this
building
because
this
building
is
the
main
of
london
and
this
building
is
the
second
most
beautiful
building
in
london
so
that
why
I
recommend
you
this
building
.

From
student

all
your
enquiries
.

The
hotel
which
your

'
group
has
been
booked
into
is
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
fairly
easy
to
get
there
from
the
conference
.

I
would
suggested
you
to
walk
along
New
Street
,
which
is
the
one
next
to
river
,
and
in
10
minutes

The
hotel
is
just
opposite
to
the
City
Hospital

already
possibly
know
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
take
place
at
the
main
reception
room
at
the
same
hotel
.

You

be
there
by
7
o'clock
in
the
evening
.

Answering
your
question
,
you
should
be
fine
wearing
casual
clothes
.

However
,
if
you
wish
to
dress
smarter
,
there
is
no
problem
at
all
.

With
reference
to
the
last
afternoon
,
if
I
were
you
I
would
visit
the
City

There
are
many
interesting
works
of
art

famous
painters
of
this
country

me
at
the

INVENTIONS
HAVE
AFFECTED
ALL
OUR
LIVES
!

The
invention
without
no
doubt
,
that
has
affected
my
own
life
by
far
is
the
car
.

Cars
have
definitely
changed
all
our
lives
,
and
I
am
not
refering
only
in
a
positive
way
,
but
in
a
negative
way
as
well
.

Picture
this
:
a
big
city
such
as
London
or
New
York
with
no
cars
on
their
streets
.

Could
you
imagine
it
?

To
be
honest
,
I
ca
n't
.

Cars
are
part
of
our
daily
lives
.

Traffic
jams
make
people
nervous
,
sometimes
really
upset
and
violent
.

But
,
anyway
,
people
use
cars
.

If
we
do
n't
use
them
we
suffer
from
them
.

In
my
case
I
use
public
transport
during
the
week
to
go
to
work
but
I
could
hardly
imagine
my
weekends
without
my
beloved
car
.

I
really
need
it
to
escape
from
the
pollution
,
mainly
caused
by
cars
and
any
other
four
-
wheel
motored
vehicle
.

Is
n't
that
contradictorious
?

To
go
to
the
countryside
and
being
able
to
breath
fresh
,
non
-
polluted
air
,
I
use
my
car
,
which
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
does
not
help
to
maintain
a
clean
air
at
all
.

Therefore
I
am
thinking
in
selling
my
car
,
which
has
changed
my
life
over
the
last
10
years
,
which
has
given
me
a
kind
of
freedom
,
which
has
gone
with
me
to
all
sort
of
fantastic
places
,
and
change
my
life
for
a
new
life
:
whithout
car
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
.

I
have
just
received
your
letter
.

It
was
very
sorry
news
to
Richard
Brown
.

I
have
given
much
information
of
the
international
student
conference
.

Firstly
,
the
conference
will
take
place
in
the
Palace
Hotel
and
we
get
from
our
college
to
there
by
bus
.

Number
45
bus
runs
to
there
every
5
minutes
.

It
takes
25
minutes
that
is
convenient
to
us
.

Secondly
,
there
are
some
programme
that
are
very
great
.

First
time
,
the
conference
's
head
make
a
short
speech
and
then
we
have
dinner
and
drinks
.

Finally
we
enjoy
a
disco
party
so
you
wear
a
suiteable
dress
.

On
the
last
day
I
go
to
your
house
and
then
we
think
about
our
's
conference
plane
.

I
hope
it
will
be
a
successful
conference
.

See
you
soon
.

Yours
sincerely

Alice
knew
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
special
day
for
her
.

Alice
and
Jane
came
back
her
home
.

Alice
is
Jane
's
boy
friend
.

In
the
morning
they
have
met
and
then
they
went
to
beach
.

It
was
nice
weather
and
beautiful
time
.

In
the
evening
they
were
going
to
the
disco
party
that
was
Jane
's
friend
's
birthday
party
.

Jane
suddenly
thought
about
her
house
key
that
left
inside
her
house
and
Alice
could
see
the
her
house
and
he
found
the
bathroom
window
was
opening
.

So
he
crimbed
on
the
radder
up
to
the
window
and
he
opened
the
door
but
policemen
came
there
\"
what
happened
?
\"

Jane
expained
that
situations
and
they
under
stood
him
.

So
they
could
go
to
the
disco
party
.

It
was
a
very
wonderful
party
and
they
have
never
forgot
that
day
.

It
was
a
very
very
special
day
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
:

I
am
writting
to
give
you
the
information
that
you
asked
me
for
.

the
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Harris
hotel
.

this
hotel
is
very
good
placed
.

From
there
you
can
get
a
taxi
,
catch
the
buses
seven
and
eleven
,
wich
both
have
you
very
close
to
the
conference
place
,
and
also
you
can
go
by
underground
to
get
there
.

the
conference
starts
at
5:30
pm
and
it
finishes
at
8:00PM
.

Then
,
after
the
Conference
,
there
will
be
a
formal
party
at
the
group
's
hotel
,
wich
starts
at
9:00
PM
and
finishes
at
12:00
AM
.

this
party
is
a
formal
one
,
so
you
should
be
casual
dressed
.

In
this
area
you
could
visit
the
central
park
.

It
is
very
beautiful
and
a
very
good
place
to
relax
.

Another
place
that
would
be
interesting
to
visit
is
the
old
cathedral
of
the
city
.

I
hope
these
information
could
be
useful
for
you
.

Hampton
Court
Palace

Introduction
:

I
have
been
asked
for
information
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

I
went
to
Hampton
Court
last
year
,
and
I
think
it
is
a
great
place
to
visit
.

Location
:

Hampton
Court
palace
is
localizated
in
Hampton
Court
.

In
addition
to
that
,
I
think
this
town
is
wonderful
and
it
has
a
magical
beauty
.

transport
:

to
get
to
Hampton
Court
palace
,
you
need
to
take
a
train
from
Waterloo
train
station
.

From
there
depart
the
trains
to
Hampton
Court
.

Moreover
,
I
think
by
train
is
the
best
way
to
get
there
,
because
Hampton
Court
train
station
is
very
close
to
Hampton
Court
palace
.

Price
:

there
is
a
great
price
for
children
,
students
,
adults
and
families
.

They
are
between
three
and
six
pounds
each
.

Conclusion
:

Hampton
Court
Palace
is
a
building
with
lots
of
history
and
interesting
things
to
see
.

And
also
it
would
be
an
excellent
chance
for
this
group
of
American
students
to
see
it
.

To
:
Mrs.
Smith

Thank
you

miles
away
from
our
College
,
the
hotel
will
have
a
coach
to
pick
the
group
up
from
the
airport
on
19th
of
June
and
then
take
the
group
to
Conference
and
return
to
hotel
every
day
.

Regarding
to
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

We
have
planed
a
barbecue
at
5
oo
pm
.
on
our
most
idyllic
play
field
which
is
over
looking
the
endless
Countryside
and
farms
.

At
7:00pm
.

we
can
move
to
our
student
hall
to
have
a
disc
dance
until
10:00pm
.

On
the
last
day
,
we
have
arranged
a
small
party
in
the
hotel
,
then
we
all
set
up
to
have
a
sightseeing
Bromley
town
center
for
about
two
hours
before
you
leave
for
airport
.

Bromley
town
center
is
the
most
beautiful
shopping
centre
in
South
East
London
.

There
are
many
historical
buildings
remain
.

I
think
the
students
will
enjoy
this
sightseeing
.

If
any
further
discussion
,
please
let
me
know
.

Yours
.
sincerely
,

How
wonderful
\"
light
\"

We
need
light
every
day
,
not
just
night
time
.

We
need
lamp
light
in
offices
or
schools
or
some
places
during
the
day
time
.

How
is
the
wonderful
life
after
invention
the
light
.

Here
we
just
talk
about
the
light
we
invented
apart
from
nature
light
.

When
I
was
small
,
we
lived
in
country
yard
,
I
remembered
,
we
used
to
have
oil
lamps
which
used
a
cotton
string
dipping
in
the
oil
in
the
small
bottle
and
made
it
burned
the
tip
of
the
cotton
string
to
give
us
light
during
the
night
time
,
it
was
very
little
light
on
,
and
many
things
we
could
n't
do
under
the
oil
lamps
because
the
light
range
was
very
small
.

There
was
no
any
light
outside
our
house
,
no
light
on
the
road
or
field
either
.

I
was
always
very
scared
whenever
or
wherever
.
because
most
places
.

Covered
by
dark
,
dark
and
dark
.

This
scaring
dark
is
still
affecting
my
life
now
.

I
never
stayed
out
after
dark
today
except
accompanying
by
my
family
.

What
a
biggest
person
on
the
earth
,
who
invented
the
light
,
Einstein
was
.

He
created
another
day
time
after
sunset
,
people
use
it
to
do
anything
they
want
to
do
,
We
believe
we
ca
n't
live
without
light
today
,
specially
in
city
life
,
we
have
a
long
time
to
spend
for
the
activities
after
Sun
going
to
bed
.

Which
we
definately
need
light
to
keep
on
.
I
dare
to
say
,
without
light
,
our
life
will
go
into
a
dark
,
dark
hell
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writting
you
to
reply
your
question
about
the
conference
in
London
.
thank
you

II
International

Hall
college
next

.

I
would

to
inform
you
that
the
group
you

has
been

Albert
Hall
College
,
the
building
where
will
be
taken
part

conference
is

Green
Park
Avenue
;
so
,
to
get
it
from

Palace
Hotel
you

,
otherwise
,
you
can
take

Introduction

The
aim
of
this
report
is
giving
some
suggestions
to
a
group
of
American
students
who
has
just
arrived
in
Rome
and
want
some
information
about
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

Rome
is
a
big
city
where
they
can
find
several
moments
and
important
buildings
,
for
this
reason
I
would
suggest
them
to
visit

1
)
\"
Fontana
di
Trevi
\"
sited
in
Trevis
Square
in
the
center
of
Rome
.

That
's
a
small
square
where
there
is
a
fountain
very
big
.

It
was
built
by
Canovas
architect
in
1638
.

That
is
the
fountain
which
\"
Dolce
Vita
\"
film
was
taken
place
.

2
)
For
other
hand
,
there
is
Villa
Borghese
Building
,
That
is
a
museum
where
they
can
find
the
most
important
sculptures
and
pictures
of
Antonio
Canovas
and
,
Bernini
,
who
stayed
for
a
long
time
working
in
Rome
.

CONCLUSION

I
would
recommend
them
the
buildings
because
:

1
)
First
of
all
,
there
are
sited
in
the
center
of
Rome
so
,
they
can
take
a
bus
to
get
them
move
and
around
the
city
.

2
)
Secondly
,
they
can
enjoy
visiting
museums
,
and
afterwards
they
can
take
something
to
eat
or
to
drink
in
the
\"
pizzerias
'
and
restaurants
near
these
famous
places
.

In
conclusion
,
they
could
combine
art
,
the
history
and
the
night
visiting
one
only
place
without
spend
much
money
.

Dear
Marie
,

I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
our
friend
Mr
Brown
is
ill
.

As
our
conference
is
due
to
start
next
week
I
respond
straight
away
.

There
are
some
informations
you
have
asked
me
about
.

We
booked
rooms
for
your
group
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

That
is
the
best
option
because
it
is
placed
less
than
5
minutes
walk
from
the
Conference
Center
.

When
you
live
a
hotel
you
have
to
turn
right
and
you
bloun
the
street
.

At
the
first
traffic
lights
turn
right
again
and
you
should
see
a
big
blue
building
.

That
's
our
Conference
Center
.

At
the
hotel
reception
you
will
find
printed
information
how
to
get
over
there
.

As
you
know
at
the
end
-
of
-
conference
there
is
a
party
.

Party
is
due
to
start
at
8
p.m
until
3
a.m.
There
is
2hr
break
between
end
-
of
-
conference
and
party
.

At
this
time
you
and
your
group
can
refresh
yourself
.

I
would
like
to
mention
that
because
our
conference
that
is
dress
-
code
party
.

Hope
you
will
enjoy
it
.

We
prepared
some
special
attraction
like
live
dance
music
and
hot
or
cold
buffet
.

About
you
're
the
last
question
I
can
sugest
to
visit
the
Royal
Castle
.

That
will
give
you
and
your
guests
an
impression
about
our
country
and
history
.

Your
sincerely
,

In
our
town
there
is
so
many
interesting
places
to
see
that
there
is
hard
to
choose
one
.

In
my
opinion
the
most
interesting
is
the
Castle
.

It
is
placed
on
a
hill
so
it
is
very
easy
to
recognize
when
is
it
.

Just
look
up
and
you
will
see
that
huge
building
.

Actually
it
is
a
whole
complex
,
the
Old
and
the
New
Castle
,
Cathedrall
and
the
most
interesting
undergroud
part
with
it
's
amazing
crypts
.

And
if
you
climb
on
the
top
of
the
main
tower
-
the
keep
you
will
see
unforgetable
view
on
a
white
toun
.

After
that
you
can
explore
our
great
museum
at
the
Old
Castle
.

You
will
find
there
an
amazing
collection
of
old
weapon
,
armores
and
,
we
are
especially
pround
of
it
,
the
great
collection
of
swords
.

After
that
I
am
sure
you
will
be
happy
to
find
a
few
restaurands
located
at
the
New
Castle
.

I
am
sure
that
should
be
enought
for
one
day
trip
.

For
you
information
I
can
say
that
at
this
time
we
have
five
weeks
festival
and
this
night
there
will
be
a
great
display
.

That
should
complete
that
amazing
day
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
this
letter
in
reply
to
your
letter
which
arrived
yesterday
.

I
do
welcome
you
and
your
group
,
and
I
am
willing
to
help
you
by
giving
the
informations
that
you
have
asked
me
.

Firstly
,
let
me
explain
the
way
from
the
PALACE
HOTEL
,
where
your
group
will
be
staying
,
to
the
conference
.

The
hotel
is
located
in
the
centre
of
Seoul
,
therefore
there
many
ways
to
get
to
the
conference
.

The
easiest
way
to
get
there
is
to
take
the
underground
,
which
takes
about
20
minutes
.

The
map
will
be
given
to
you
on
the
day
of
your
arrival
.

Secondly
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
be
held
in
the
Palace
Hotel
's
Percel
Room
and
starts
at
6
o'clock
in
the
evening
.

Professor
Kim
from
my
college
is
going
to
give
a
speech
,
and
after
that
dinner
will
be
served
.

The
party
is
not
very
formal
,
so
you
can
wear
any
kind
of
dress
,
as
long
as
it
is
suitable
for
dinner
.

Finally
,
I
would
like
you
to
recommend
the
visit
to
a
traditional
Korean
palace
Kyong
Bok
for
the
last
day
's
free
time
.

It
must
be
a
very
interesting
visit
for
the
students
who
has
never
experienced
an
oriental
atmosphere
.

It
is
just
5
minutes
walk
from
the
hotel
,
and
in
front
of
the
hotel
gate
,
an
airport
bus
will
be
waiting
for
you
to
take
you
to
the
airport
after
finishing
the
outing
.

I
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
stay
in
Korea
,
and
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
for
any
further
information
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
soon
,

Yours
sincerely
,

Report
on
Kyoung
Bok
Palace
-
the
Glory
of
Chosun
Kingdom
.

.

Introduction
.

This
report
provides
the
information
about
Kyong
Bok
Palace
,
which
is
highly
recommended
to
visit
for
visitors
from
foreign
countries
.

It
highlights
the
background
history
and
considers
the
interest
of
young
peoples
,
and
makes
a
final
recommendation
.

.

History
.

The
kingdom
Chosun
has
a
history
for
500
years
and
lasted
until
the
beginning
of
20th
century
.

Kyong
Bok
Palace
was
the
main
residence
of
the
royal
family
,
so
you
will
be
able
to
imagine
its
size
.

As
the
kings
of
Chosun
loved
to
be
a
part
of
the
nature
,
the
palace
had
a
huge
garden
,
however
it
was
destroyed
by
the
army
of
Japan
,
and
now
there
remains
only
a
part
of
the
original
palace
.

There
is
a
special
monument
for
the
last
queen
of
Chosun
who
was
killed
by
the
Japanese
army
.

.

Activity
.

The
reason
that
this
palace
is
also
popular
for
the
youngsters
,
who
tends
to
dislike
the
historical
visit
,
would
be
the
various
activity
.

You
can
try
the
traditional
games
of
Korea
and
there
is
a
chance
to
wear
the
traditional
clothes
of
the
Royals
.

Also
there
are
performances
which
helds
daily
in
the
front
gate
of
the
palace
.

.

Final
Recommendation
.

It
is
out
of
question
not
to
visit
Kyong
Bok
Palace
unless
you
do
not
want
to
know
about
Korean
history
.

You
will
find
many
interesting
points
there
,
therefore
,
I
urge
you
to
visit
the
place
,
if
you
want
to
experience
the
tradition
of
Korea
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
response
to
your
letter
where
you
asked
me
to
give
you
more
information
about
international
student
conference
and
give
some
ideas
and
suggestions
of
what
you
and
your
students
can
do
during
your
free
time
here
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
which
is
located
in
the
central
area
of
the
city
,
so
it
will
not
take
you
and
your
students
too
much
time
to
get
to
the
town
hall
where
the
conference
is
supposed
to
be
progressed
.

The
easiest
way
to
get
there
from
your
hotel
is
to
take
buses
461
or
176
(
the
bus
stop
is
opposite
to
the
hotel
)
or
we
can
hire
a
minibus
for
you
but
there
is
an
extra
charge
for
it
.

There
is
a
party
on
the
last
day
of
the
conference
.

Special
awards
will
be
given
to
the
students
whose
reports
are
the
best
.

Less
of
the
party
is
likely
to
be
as
our
night
club
so
a
lots
of
music
,
dancing
and
fun
are
provided
.

Please
note
that
the
alchocholich
drinks
are
only
sold
untill
11
pm
.

You
can
wear
whatever
you
like
for
this
kind
of
party
.

Coming
back
to
ideas
and
Suggestions
I'v
promised
to
give
you
about
free
afternoon
befor
you
catch
your
plane
I
can
advise
you
to
visit
our
zoo
or
to
for
a
picnik
in
a
park
befor
you
will
go
to
the
night
party
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Can
you
see
how
many
inventions
you
are
surrounded
with
in
your
life
?

Such
a
simple
and
usuall
things
like
a
telefone
,
a
car
,
a
computer
so
only
seem
to
be
normal
and
usuall
for
us
(
or
we
have
got
used
)
as
we
use
them
every
day
.

Hundred
years
before
people
could
n't
even
use
an
electric
lump
not
saying
about
a
car
or
computer
.

They
have
intentions
improved
our
life
a
lot
since
they
had
appeared
,
but
not
every
one
beleives
it
is
really
so
.

Some
people
say
that
many
of
important
inventions
in
our
live
are
not
so
good
and
useful
as
we
have
got
used
to
see
them
.

First
of
all
they
say
about
enviroment
pollution
which
cars
and
other
vechicles
make
,
overspending
the
electricity
using
electric
equipment
and
some
others
.

But
to
my
opinion
if
peoples
inventions
take
a
place
in
our
lifes
they
are
right
then
.

I
think
the
telefone
is
the
most
important
thing
in
many
people
's
lifes
as
it
makes
you
to
be
able
to
get
in
touch
with
anyone
does
n't
matter
wherever
you
are
(
I
am
talking
about
mobile
phones
which
now
have
a
majority
of
our
choice
)
.

Computers
make
everything
much
faster
so
everything
is
now
based
on
computer
systems
.

An
electric
lamp
was
an
important
invention
hundred
years
before
(
but
for
that
time
it
was
like
a
revolution
)
.

I
think
it
would
n't
be
possible
to
survive
for
us
without
an
eclectric
life
.

Because
of
shipbuilding
development
people
could
make
all
the
geographical
discoveries
,
and
an
automobile
transport
is
undenyable
neccecerity
in
our
life
.

In
case
of
all
said
I
am
more
likely
to
think
that
the
benefits
of
advantages
of
peopel
's
inventions
are
much
higre
the
all
their
disadvantages
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
have
just
read
your
letter
and
I
am
happy
to
help
with
giving
you
some
further
information
.

According
to
your
first
question
,
for
the
time
of
conference
the
students
will
be
staying
at
the
Palace
Hotel
,
where
the
reservation
has
been
already
made
.

It
is
situated
near
to
our
college
,
about
five
minutes
walk
from
the
nearest
tube
station
,
which
is
South
Wimbledon
.

As
you
were
informed
,
there
will
be
a
party
for
all
attendants
of
the
conference
,
which
will
take
place
afterwards
at
the
hotel
restaurant
.

Minding
the
fact
that
it
will
be
entirely
sociable
meeting
I
believe
that
casual
clothes
are
the
most
suitable
option
for
this
event
.

Finally
,
answering
your
last
question
about
student
's
day
-
out
,
I
suggest
visiting
a
local
Lawn
tennis
Museums
and
Wimbledon
Tennis
Courts
as
it
is
one
of
the
best
international
tourists
attractions
.

If
you
have
any
further
questione
,
please
do
not
hesitate
to
contact
me
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

:
Leader
of
the
group
of
American
students

SUBJECT
:
Recomnendations
of
a
place
to
visit

INTRODUCTION
:

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
give
description
and
recommendation
of
the
most
interesting
building
in
the
town
.

GENERAL
INFORMATION
:

The
place
I
would
like
to
recommend
is
the
seventienth
-
century
Royal
Palace
.

It
is
situated
in
a
heart
of
Warsaw
and
surrounded
by
the
buildings
of
an
Old
Town
.

There
is
a
square
old
Market
with
the
magnificent
statue
of
the
King
Zygmunt
,
in
the
centre
of
it
.

FACILITIES
:

.

Inside
the
Palace
,
there
is
a
museum
of
an
antique
collection
of
porcalaine
.

.

There
is
also
a
Portrait
Gallery
in
the
left
wing
of
the
Palace
.

.

The
Old
Town
is
the
best
place
for
afternoon
stroll
with
a
great
deal
of
restaurants
,
caffes
and
street
performers
.

.

There
is
an
easy
reach
to
cashpoints
,
lavatories
,
emergency
services
,
etc
.

POSITIVE
POINTS

.

It
is
easy
to
get
there
by
any
sort
of
public
transport

.

There
are
numbers
of
hotels
or
youth
hostels
to
stay
overninight
,
if
necessary

.

Most
of
the
admissions
are
absolutely
free
.

NEGATIVE
POINTS

.

A
part
of
the
Palace
might
be
closed
,
due
to
the
constant
renovations
.

.

All
the
facilities
are
usually
overcrowded
during
a
summer
holiday
.

CONCLUSION
:

Despite
the
few
drawbacks
,
I
would
strongly
recommend
the
Royal
Palace
as
the
most
suitable
place
to
visit
for
the
foreign
students
.

very
danger
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
am
writing
to
give
you
some
advice
of
an
international
student
conference
.

First
of
all
,
the
name
of
hotel
which
we
have
been
booked
into
is
Palace
Hotel
.

And
we
have
two
choices
to
get
to
the
conference
,
a
bus
or
a
train
.

Both
of
them
are
as
convinience
as
getting
there
.

The
day
before
we
will
leave
there
,
we
have
a
party
which
takes
place
in
our
hotel
.

It
is
a
kind
of
formal
party
,
so
we
should
be
well
-
dressed
.

I
suggest
that
you
wear
a
formal
dress
.

There
is
some
finger
foods
and
drinks
.

It
might
be
a
great
party
for
end
of
conference
.

End
of
all
,
in
my
opinion
we
could
go
a
center
of
the
town
because
there
is
many
places
to
have
a
look
and
go
shopping
.

It
's
quite
a
nice
and
a
suitable
place
to
spend
for
three
hours
.

It
could
be
interesting
for
them
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Imagine
our
life
without
a
telephone
.

If
a
telephone
haven't
been
invented
,
we
would
n't
have
lived
perfectly
like
nowadays
.

Would
n't
you
think
we
rely
on
it
more
than
we
expect
?

A
telephone
is
used
when
we
need
to
contact
with
someone
,
and
also
an
emergency
situation
and
an
internet
.

It
has
various
way
to
use
,
however
,
nowadays
it
is
not
only
used
by
these
purpose
,
but
also
it
keeps
our
company
.

Even
if
you
feel
alone
,
you
can
talk
and
hear
from
your
friend
easily
.

Then
it
makes
you
happy
.

Long
time
ago
people
lived
without
this
perfect
invention
.

But
how
?

They
used
to
keep
in
touch
with
someone
with
a
letter
.

In
spite
of
taking
a
lot
of
time
to
catch
up
with
,
it
was
a
only
way
.

So
that
's
why
they
have
invented
a
telephon
.

Now
we
could
feel
the
world
closer
and
closer
beaus
of
a
telephone
.

Who
would
n't
thank
for
this
great
invention
?

Dear
Madam
,

I
received
your
letter
and
I
'm
pleased
to
answer
your
questions
.

M.
Brown
has
booked
rooms
in
the
Palace
Hotel
.

This
is
a
first
class
hotel
.

The
easiest
way
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
is
with
the
bus
.

There
is
a
bus
stop
in
front
of
your
hotel
.

Take
the
bus
in
direction
center
town
.

After
four
stops
get
off
the
bus
.

The
name
of
this
bus
stop
is
'
Kongresshaus
'
.

If
you
leave
the
bus
,
the
conference
is
in
the
house
opposite
the
road
.

You
ca
n't
miss
it
.

Afterwards
we
will
eat
together
in
a
restaurant
and
we
will
go
in
a
disco
.

For
the
disco
you
musn't
wear
blue
jeans
.

Finally
at
your
last
day
I
propose
you
to
do
a
sightseeing
tour
in
our
town
.

It
takes
you
two
hours
.

Afterwards
you
will
have
any
time
to
buy
some
souvenirs
from
Switzerland
.

If
you
have
any
more
questions
,
write
me
back
.

Yours
sincerely
,

I
will
write
about
the
invention
of
the
computer
.

With
the
computer
our
work
is
easier
and
more
interesting
.

Before
the
time
with
computers
,
people
had
to
write
every
time
a
whole
letter
.

When
they
would
correct
a
word
,
they
had
to
write
the
whole
letter
again
.

With
the
computer
we
can
write
a
letter
,
correct
a
word
or
change
the
name
without
writting
the
whole
letter
again
.
We
save
the
letter
and
in
three
week
we
could
send
it
to
another
person
.

I
work
at
a
bank
and
I
work
all
day
with
computers
.

If
we
hand't
ay
one
,
we
had
to
write
all
the
transactions
on
papers
.

If
I
order
money
for
our
bank
with
the
computer
I
can
be
sure
that
I
will
arrive
the
day
after
.

But
if
I
had
to
write
a
letter
and
to
send
it
by
post
,
the
money
will
arrive
two
or
three
days
after
.

I
have
never
work
without
a
computer
,
but
if
we
had
n't
any
we
would
it
find
normally
.

Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
'm
pleased
to
be
able
to
help
you
for
the
international
student
conference
.

The
hotel
in
which
the
group
has
been
booked
to
is
the
Palace
hotel
,
which
is
situated
near
the
big
bridge
of
Mont
Blanc
.

To
get
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
,
you
have
to
take
the
highway
indirection
of
Lausanne
,
and
after
nearly
half
an
hour
of
driving
you
come
out
at
the
place
which
is
indicated
with
Coppet
,
Divonne
.

When
you
come
out
,
just
go
on
your
right
,
and
then
turn
left
to
follow
the
indications
to
the
Châtaigneroie
school
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
take
place
at
the
same
place
.

Some
musicians
will
play
classical
music
,
and
there
will
be
many
different
drinks
and
food
.

you
should
wear
some
formal
clothes
,
but
not
necessary
really
pretty
clothes

For
three
hours
,
you
could
visit
the
museum
of
the
Red
Cross
,
which
is
very
interesting
.

I
hope
that
these
informations
will
help
you

Sincerely
yours
,

The
portable
phone
,
a
very
useful
invention
!

During
all
mankind
history
,
there
were
discovers
who
tried
to
make
human
life
better
,
but
it
is
in
the
last
century
that
there
were
the
most
biggest
discoveries
made
.

When
the
phone
without
cable
was
invented
,
one
was
n't
sure
if
it
would
be
a
success
or
not
.

But
the
research
went
on
,
and
the
portable
phone
is
getting
always
smaller
and
more
useful
.

The
portable
phone
is
an
important
invention
,
because
nearly
everybody
has
one
,
and
so
one
can
always
call
somebody
if
there
is
a
problem
.

Moreover
,
some
portable
phones
have
a
connection
to
the
web
,
so
it
is
easy
to
read
newspapers
if
one
hasn't
enough
money
to
buy
it
.

Personally
,
the
portable
phone
has
affected
my
own
life
,
because
when
somebody
is
phoning
at
home
,
I
do
n't
have
to
rush
to
take
the
phone
,
being
afraid
that
it
's
too
late
.

I
recommend
this
extremely
important
invention
to
those
who
still
do
n't
have
a
portable
phone
.

Dear
Maria
,

I
would
be
pleased
to
help
you
about
all
your
questions
and
I
will
provide
you
some
information
which
you
need
as
much
as
I
can
.

I
would
like
to
inform
you
that
Centeral
Red
Lion
Hotel
has
been
booked
for
the
accomadation
of
the
group
and
it
will
be
quite
easy
to
get
every
where
from
the
hotel
on
foot
during
your
stay
.

As
you
know
that
we
arrange
an
evening
party
on
the
third
day
of
the
week
,
we
can
say
that
a
kind
of
relaxation
time
.

Nothing
will
be
spacial
.

Place
is
College
garden
.

Time
is
7
pm
.

There
is
no
need
to
bother
about
clouths
.

Everybody
can
put
on
something
casual
.

Befor
leav
from
England
I
suggest
you
to
visit
the
cannals
and
small
villages
around
Basingstoke
.
You
could
find
the
opportunaty
to
see
the
country
life
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Time
flies

I
have
to
admit
that
whoever
invented
the
cars
and
transportation
vehicles
did
the
most
respectable
invention
of
the
word
.

I
say
that
it
must
be
the
most
important
thing
for
us
because
they
save
our
times
passing
so
fast
.

Can
you
deny
how
quickly
we
get
somewhere
by
car
or
by
bus
.

May
be
10
times
as
quick
as
getting
somewhere
on
foot
.

Try
to
imagine
your
life
without
having
anyof
them
.

Would
n't
be
unbarable
and
painful
.

Ceartainly
it
would
be
just
like
mine
.

Because
I
live
in
a
rural
area
far
from
any
village
,
town
,
or
city
center
.

The
nearest
civilization
takes
me
1
hour
on
foot
.

I
have
no
car
,
no
local
bus
service
to
use
.

Even
comeing
to
Basingstoke
seems
like
a
international
journey
to
me
.

And
ofcause
this
stops
me
everytime
to
live
sociable
life
.

But
also
I
'm
aware
of
that
the
time
flies
for
me
.
I
must
do
whatever
I
want
befor
it
is
too
late
.

And
I
have
to
confess
the
invention
of
the
car
was
the
most
usefull
invention
for
the
humanity
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

I
was
delighted
to
receive
your
letter
and
to
know
that
a
group
of
students
from
your
college
have
decided
to
take
a
part
in
our
international
student
conference
.

As
you
need
more
information
,
I
answer
all
your
questions
with
plesuare
.

Firstly
,
the
Palace
Hotel
has
been
booked
for
your
group
.

It
is
one
of
the
most
comfortable
hotels
in
our
sity
and
situated
only
half
a
mile
from
main
building
of
our
college
,
so
it
is
very
simple
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
by
foot
.

Secondly
,
our
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
included
dinner
and
dancing
,
I
would
advise
you
to
wear
something
not
very
formal
.

Finally
,
you
can
spend
an
afternoon
on
the
last
day
visiting
local
historical
places
(
castles
,
builded
in
13-th
century
)
or
art
gallery
,
as
well
as
beatiful
Bodnant
garden
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
the
meeting
with
you
and
mutual
work
during
conference
.

Your
sincerely

There
are
many
different
people
's
inventions
around
us
.

We
are
so
used
to
them
,
that
sometimes
think
they
existed
always
.

Some
of
them
are
very
practical
,
other
are
rather
strange
.

I
thing
,
that
one
of
the
most
importent
and
affecting
our
life
inventions
is
the
telephone
.

Imagine
life
without
phone
.

You
are
on
the
road
,
you
have
car
accident
.

What
are
you
going
to
do
without
phone
?

On
another
situation
,
your
son
is
ill
,
he
needs
help
urgently
.

I
am
sure
,
the
phone
has
saved
many
lifes
.

Besides
,
it
is
always
very
nice
to
ring
your
friend
or
mum
,
only
for
chating
in
any
time
.

Thanks
the
phone
,
it
is
possible
even
your
mam
is
on
the
other
end
of
the
Earth
.

To
be
honest
,
next
great
invention
of
people
,
computer
,
ca
n't
work
,
if
you
haven't
got
the
phone
.

So
I
am
very
grateful
to
man
,
who
invented
it
,
unfornutely
,
I
have
forgotten
his
name
.

It
always
happens
with
people
,
does
n't
?

Try
to
ask
who
invented
the
will
or
the
book
.

Chêne
-
Bourg
,
Tuesday
12th
June

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

it
is
with
great
regret
that
I
hear
of
Mr
Brown
's
illness
,
and
hope
to
see
him
soon
in
an
excellent
health
.

Nevertheless
,
I
am
both
pleased
and
honoured
to
expect
you
and
your
group
in
the
context
of
our
international
meeting
.

We
have
made
arrangements
for
you
to
stay
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

Furthermore
,
since
it
is
located
between
the
airport
and
our
location
,
a
bus
shuttle
has
been
organised
to
pick
all
our
guests
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
room
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
to
be
held
at
the
'
Royal
Room
'
of
the
hotel
,
which
has
an
outstanding
reputation
for
its
quality
and
seriousness
.

Therefore
,
all
guests
will
be
asked
to
wear
the
corresponding
clothes
in
order
to
be
accepted
.

As
for
the
three
hours
of
free
time
,
I
strongly
suggest
you
to
check
-
in
your
lugages
at
the
airport
and
then
,
after
a
five
-
minutes
bus
ride
,
spend
your
time
in
the
marvellous
'
Old
City
'
.

Best
Regards
,

My
fair
Mobile
Phone
.

The
technological
revolution
taking
place
today
can
be
directly
linked
to
the
amazing
evolution
of
our
communication
abilities
throughout
those
last
years
.

The
inevitable
invention
symbolizing
this
aspect
in
our
ordinary
life
is
,
of
course
,
the
mobile
phone
.

It
is
clear
and
irrefutable
that
the
use
of
this
invention
has
becomed
a
necessary
condition
in
some
professional
activities
.

Trades
,
politicians
and
taxi
drivers
are
but
a
few
examples
of
such
needs
.

However
,
the
common
man
seems
to
ignore
how
important
and
useful
a
mobile
phone
becomes
,
when
in
the
hands
of
a
high
-
school
student
.

It
becomes
then
a
real
obsession
for
the
average
students
,
as
e
uses
it
before
the
lessons
,
during
the
lessons
,
during
lunch
and
,
especially
,
during
examinations
...

Nevertheless
,
it
is
also
a
common
mistake
to
believe
that
the
sole
purpose
of
such
an
usage
is
to
communicate
information
during
an
exam
,
since
its
major
role
is
actually
to
allow
the
student
and
the
parents
to
discuss
during
everyday
's
courses
.

Bottom
line
is
that
any
teacher
complaining
about
this
situation
should
confiscate
not
the
student
's
phone
,
but
his
parents
'
!

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

I
have
just
received
the
letter
from
you
and
I
'm
writting
to
you
as
soon
as
posible
.

I
can
promise
to
you
that
I
'll
do
my
best
to
help
you
.

You
told
me
that
you
are
the
leader
of
a
group
of
students
this
year
,
because
Mr.
Brown
is
ill
.

Poor
Mr.
Brown
,
I
hope
he
will
get
better
soon
.

As
I
've
just
checked
the
group
has
been
booked
into
The
Palace
Hotel
.

The
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
by
coache
,
that
I
have
arranged
for
you
.

The
driver
Mr.
Olsson
works
for
us
since
.

He
will
pick
you
up
at
11
oo
a.m.
The
conference
is
from
12
oo
to
2
oo
p.m.
At
the
end
of
conference
is
a
party
from
2
oo
to
3
oo
.

I
suggest
you
to
wear
comfortable
and
nice
clothes
because
I
have
planed
a
sightseeing
for
you
before
your
plane
at
8
oo
p.m.
I
'd
like
to
show
you
a
museum
,
a
gallery
and
the
gardens
that
are
belonging
to
the
palace
.

Then
we
can
have
a
rest
in
the
caffee
and
talk
before
your
flight
home
.

I
think
I
gave
you
all
importen
informations
.

I
hope
to
see
you
all
soon
,

Yours
sincerely
,

Nowdays
motorization
is
one
of
the
most
important
inventions
.

As
you
look
amoung
everybody
has
a
car
or
motorcycle
.

No
matter
that
people
started
worred
more
about
polution
in
the
world
.

Let
me
to
tell
you
,
how
invention
of
motorcycle
has
affected
my
life
.

I
love
motocycles
and
I
do
n't
think
I
could
live
without
them
.

I
drive
motocycle
since
I
was
16
year
old
.

Me
and
my
brother
we
used
to
go
to
the
rock
concerts
.

We
have
met
a
lot
of
people
there
same
mad
about
motorcycle
as
we
were
.

We
were
avenging
races
and
trips
.

We
were
driving
motocycles
few
day
befour
we
finally
had
got
to
mitting
points
.

I
really
enjoy
driving
motocycle
.

People
say
that
is
dangerous
,
I
do
n't
think
so
.

When
I
drive
is
only
me
and
my
motocycle
.

Before
me
and
after
are
my
friends
that
I
like
and
trust
.

And
around
me
nature
that
I
can
watch
and
enjoy
while
we
shop
fore
camp
.

We
can
go
to
any
place
we
like
,
avoid
traffic
and
to
full
buses
,
trains
,
etc
.

I
am
really
greatful
for
people
who
invented
the
first
motocycle
in
the
world
.

I
feel
very
bad
about
that
I
do
n't
know
who
was
it
.

On
the
other
hand
no
matter
that
I
feel
very
good
about
that
because
that
invention
has
changed
and
affected
my
life
end
people
I
care
about
,
has
affected
my
life
in
a
very
best
way
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
very
much
for
your
letter
.

As
you
asked
me
in
the
letter
,
I
am
very
happy
to
help
you
with
finding
out
details
of
the
conference
.

The
hotel
that
your
group
will
be
staying
at
is
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
reasonably
near
to
the
college
,
so
it
may
be
very
good
to
walk
from
the
hotel
along
River
Thames
following
yellow
signs
on
sunny
days
.

If
it
rains
,
you
can
take
bus
54
that
stops
in
front
of
the
college
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
designed
to
give
rough
ideas
about
many
different
cultures
.

So
you
will
enjoy
traditional
foods
,
music
,
dances
and
games
from
all
over
the
world
.

As
a
part
of
this
,
the
leader
of
each
group
has
to
wear
a
costume
of
her
country
.

Other
members
of
groups
can
wear
a
normal
pretty
formal
dress
.

On
the
last
day
,
I
recommend
that
you
will
visit
the
place
that
is
located
at
the
centre
of
our
city
.

It
is
about
1000
years
old
,
so
I
am
sure
that
you
will
find
it
fascinating
to
see
it
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Can
you
imagine
your
life
without
any
computers
at
all
?

Well
,
I
am
sure
that
you
can
hardly
do
this
unless
you
are
living
deep
in
a
forest
or
in
a
dessert
!

If
you
think
about
how
many
computers
we
use
every
day
and
how
dependent
we
are
on
them
,
it
must
be
clear
that
invention
of
computers
has
certainly
had
a
significant
impact
on
all
our
lives
.

For
example
,
all
infrastructures
such
as
transports
and
power
stations
are
ran
using
computers
government
uses
them
to
organise
all
sorts
of
things
in
a
country
,
and
all
kids
of
services
and
businesses
such
as
hospitals
and
supermarkets
use
them
as
essential
capitals
.

In
other
words
,
almost
all
aspects
of
our
lives
today
rely
on
computers
.

So
I
am
sure
from
this
that
it
is
convincing
enough
to
say
that
invention
of
computers
is
really
important
.

From
my
personal
experience
,
I
can
also
say
that
a
personal
computer
is
also
an
amazing
tool
.

It
improves
productivity
of
my
homework
,
that
is
often
essay
writing
,
and
also
it
allows
me
to
access
to
the
internet
.

Since
I
live
abroad
,
the
internet
is
really
useful
for
me
to
have
a
contact
with
my
bestfriend
and
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
my
home
country
.

To
sum
up
,
I
can
say
that
the
greatest
ever
invention
is
the
invention
of
computers
that
has
affected
both
indivisuals
and
a
society
as
a
whole
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
reply
to
your
enquiry
about
this
year
international
conference
.

The
conference
will
be
held
at
The
Palace
Hotel
on
Old
Street
.

There
will
be
signs
to
follow
from
Central
train
station
.

The
conference
is
commensing
on
31st
June
2001
from
10.00
-
15.00
.

Light
lunch
will
be
provided
.

After
the
conference
,
there
will
be
a
relaxing
party
.

There
is
no
dressed
-
code
for
the
party
.

However
I
suggest
you
could
wear
the
same
outfit
as
you
wear
for
the
conference
.

I
have
included
the
local
map
,
there
are
some
ideas
at
the
back
of
the
map
.

Please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
to
book
one
of
the
city
-
walk
tours
,
We
have
arrange
spacial
discounts
for
the
conference
attendance
.

Personly
I
recommend
the
Dicken
's
tour
because
it
is
a
good
length
of
walking
and
very
historical
.

I
hope
that
I
have
covered
all
information
you
would
need
and
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

Your
sincerely
,

P.S.
Please
find
the
enclosed
map
.

There
are
several
interesting
buildings
in
the
city
of
London
.

I
believe
Liverpool
Street
Station
is
at
the
top
list
.

The
building
itself
looks
grand
and
elegant
.

Despite
the
fact
that
this
building
has
served
half
-
a
million
commuters
in
a
day
,
it
always
clean
and
functional
.

There
are
two
parts
of
Liverpool
Street
Station
that
make
it
so
interesting
building
.

The
newly
decorated
section
is
fairly
modern
style
with
escalators
and
touched
-
screen
ticket
machine
.

It
is
also
very
well
linked
into
the
old
underground
station
which
it
is
such
a
contrast
in
transformation
.

The
old
bit
is
rather
unique
and
charming
.

You
could
really
imagine
how
it
looked
like
in
the
old
day
.

There
is
another
surprising
section
in
this
building
.

At
the
far
back
of
the
station
is
also
connected
to
a
spacious
well
designed
pedestrians
park
.

It
is
a
good
example
of
a
great
architecture
that
was
designed
to
provide
services
to
the
public
.

Finally
,
it
is
in
the
heart
of
city
and
everyone
would
be
able
to
find
without
doubt
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith

Thank
you
for
your
letter
dated
8
June
2001
.

I
hope
I
can
give
you
the
information
you
need
.

So
the
conference
will
be
a
great
experience
to
you
and
your
group
.

Your
group
will
stay
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

The
Palace
Hotel
is
situated
in
the
town
centre
next
to
the
railway
station
.

A
free
shuttel
-
bus
gets
you
to
the
conference
-
center
.

The
bus
leavs
at
8
a.m.
at
the
front
entrance
of
the
hotel
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
playing
in
a
rent
and
in
the
greenground
.

There
will
be
a
barbecue
,
a
place
to
dance
and
many
more
.

It
is
a
surprice
!

I
suggest
to
wear
leisure
-
clothes
to
the
party
.

The
last
afternoon
you
could
go
on
a
city
-
tour
,
visite
the
museum
of
Fine
Arts
or
enjoy
the
beautiful
flower
garden
next
to
the
common
park
.

I
hope
I
could
give
you
some
ideas
.
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

What
would
life
be
without
the
phone
?

Have
you
ever
thought
about
a
world
without
phone
?

How
was
it
in
the
18
century
with
no
opportunity
to
communicate
by
phone
and
how
would
it
be
now
?

I
can
not
imagine
how
our
life
would
be
.

We
are
living
in
a
busy
world
.

In
the
business
world
you
use
the
phone
all
the
time
to
speak
with
your
clients
,
to
make
appointments
,
to
order
an
article
e.c
.
;
then
,
time
is
money
!

How
has
the
phone
affected
my
own
life
?
I
think
,
that
is
a
good
question
to
think
about
.
I
could
not
call
my
friends
from
an
other
city
and
just
say
\"
hello
\"
.

It
would
be
difficult
and
take
more
time
to
make
an
appointment
.

So
,
what
did
the
phone
-
revolution
for
us
?

It
saves
time
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
'm
writing
in
reply
to
your
letter
in
which
you
asked
me
for
help
.

I
hope
I
will
be
able
to
give
you
the
information
you
need
for
the
group
of
students
who
are
coming
to
the
conference
.

Firstly
,
the
Palace
Hotel
is
waiting
for
you
and
your
students
.

The
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
college
where
the
conference
will
take
place
is
simply
to
walk
.

Actually
,
the
college
is
situated
500
meters
away
from
the
Hotel
.

As
you
know
,
the
conference
will
be
followed
by
a
party
.

It
will
begin
at
7
p.m
and
last
until
late
in
the
evening
.

You
do
n't
need
to
worry
about
what
you
should
wear
to
this
event
.

In
fact
,
the
purpose
of
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
to
relax
after
a
busy
day
,
therefore
you
and
your
students
can
put
jeans
and
sport
shoes
on
.

To
conclude
,
we
decided
to
organize
a
guided
tour
by
coach
,
as
you
have
an
afternoon
free
before
your
plane
takes
off
.

I
hope
the
international
student
conference
will
help
to
know
each
other
better
and
that
it
will
be
a
success
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Sir
or
Madam
,

I
'm
writing
in
reply
to
your
letter
in
which
you
asked
me
information
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

There
is
so
many
places
of
interest
in
Lausanne
,
but
I
think
that
the
Olympic
Museum
is
the
most
notable
for
the
following
reasons
:

The
Olympic
Museum
dates
from
the
19th
century
and
is
the
biggest
in
Europe
.

It
shows
all
the
different
sports
men
have
been
doing
since
the
first
Olympic
Games
in
Greece
.

You
can
see
the
evolution
of
sports
and
understand
why
changes
gradually
have
been
done
to
improve
them
.

You
can
admire
every
kind
of
equipments
you
need
to
do
any
particular
sport
.

You
will
be
informed
about
the
story
of
sport
in
general
and
about
the
new
technologies
which
are
used
nowaday
n
high
competitions
.

The
museum
is
near
the
city
center
and
is
accessible
by
bus
or
walking
.

It
will
takes
you
an
afternoon
to
visit
it
and
then
you
can
enjoy
a
drink
or
a
meal
in
the
restaurant
on
the
third
floor
,
well
-
known
for
being
one
of
the
best
establishment
in
Lausanne
.

I
hope
my
recommendations
will
help
you
in
the
choice
of
a
building
to
visit
.

Yours
faithfully
,

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
'm
writing
in
response
to
the
letter
we
have
received
from
you
,
in
order
to
let
you
know
all
the
information
you
have
asked
for
.

First
of
all
,
your
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
,
Main
-
Road
21
,
which
is
situated
not
far
from
our
college
.

I
'd
suggest
you
to
walk
,
it
will
only
take
you
about
seven
minutes
.

Just
follow
Main
-
Road
until
to
reach
a
junction
,
where
you
turn
right
and
then
walk
along
Denl
-
a
-
Lion
Road
.

The
college
is
a
huge
,
yellow
building
-
you
ca
n't
miss
it
.

Secondly
,
you
have
required
information
about
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

It
will
begin
at
6
o'clock
p.m.
and
last
until
midnight
.

All
the
students
will
be
provided
with
sacks
and
we
have
managed
to
book
a
band
as
well
.

The
location
of
the
party
is
n't
fixed
yet
,
but
we
will
let
you
know
after
your
arrival
.

There
is
no
need
putting
on
special
clothes
for
the
party
,
casual
ones
should
do
it
as
well
,
for
we
want
everyone
to
feel
comfortable
.

Last
but
not
least
I
will
give
you
some
ideas
of
where
to
spend
your
free
afternoon
.

I
'd
suggest
you
to
visit
our
local
museum
,
as
there
is
a
marvellous
exhibition
there
at
the
moment
.

Provided
the
weather
is
fine
,
you
could
also
go
swimming
or
make
a
tour
through
our
beautiful
town
.

(
I
could
book
a
guide
for
you
if
you
're
interested
)

Please
write
back
or
call
me
if
there
is
any
more
information
you
need
.

I
'm
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
and
wish
you
all
the
best
.

Yours
sincerely
,

The
telephone
,
a
blessing
.

Who
of
you
could
imagine
life
without
the
telephone
?

Not
being
able
to
call
your
friend
and
ask
if
you
can
pop
in
for
a
moment
?

Not
being
able
to
lie
to
your
mother
-
in
-
law
and
pretend
you
ca
n't
attend
her
garden
party
because
of
an
illness
,
without
having
to
look
her
in
the
eye
?

When
Alexander
Graham
Bell
first
invented
the
telephone
,
he
had
no
idea
of
how
popular
it
would
be
one
day
.

Its
first
appliance
was
in
order
to
listen
to
a
concert
if
you
were
not
able
to
attend
it
in
person
.

Nowadays
,
however
,
the
whole
world
is
connected
by
a
telephone
system
and
no
one
could
imagine
life
without
it
.

Take
me
,
for
example
,
I
use
it
whenever
there
is
a
problem
and
I
need
some
advice
,
or
when
I
have
to
call
off
a
meeting
for
any
reason
.

I
can
not
always
walk
to
the
person
and
say
\"
Sorry
,
I
must
cancel
our
meeting
\"
,
because
then
it
's
too
late
anyway
,
is
n't
it
?

Life
definitely
would
n't
be
the
same
without
the
invention
of
the
telephone
.

We
use
it
daily
in
order
to
get
information
or
to
pass
it
on
.

Just
try
to
spend
one
week
without
using
a
telephone
at
all
,
and
you
will
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
.

So
do
n't
take
the
telephone
for
granted
,
but
keep
in
mind
that
our
modern
way
of
life
is
mainly
due
to
its
invention
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
am
sorry
to
learn
that
Richard
Brown
can
not
attend
the
conference
.

Please
transmit
him
my
best
wishes
for
his
recovery
.

We
have
booked
rooms
for
all
members
of
your
group
at
the
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
a
very
cosy
building
that
is
on
the
same
avenue
as
the
conference
building
,
approximetively
one
mile
away
.

There
is
a
direct
bus
link
between
the
two
locations
:
this
is
bus
line
number
six
;
the
bus
station
for
the
conference
building
is
called
\"
Avenue
de
cour
\"
and
the
one
at
the
Palace
Hotel
is
named
\"
Main
station
\"
.

Concerning
the
party
we
do
not
have
a
casual
dressing
code
.

students
usually
wear
dark
clothes
with
a
tie
for
the
boys
and
a
mid
-
long
skirt
or
dress
for
the
girls
.

There
are
a
lot
of
activities
you
can
do
during
your
free
afternoon
.

I
would
like
to
suggest
visiting
the
\"
Ethnographic
Museum
,
,
which
is
kind
of
unique
in
the
world
.

Looking
forward
to
meeting
you
soon

I
remain
,
yours
sincerely
.

The
car
:

I
think
that
the
car
is
one
of
the
human
inventions
that
has
the
most
affected
the
way
of
life
of
people
from
industrial
countries
.

Nowadays
more
than
the
percents
of
the
world
industry
is
related
to
the
automotive
business
:
car
manufacturing
,
gasoline
extracting
and
refining
,
tyres
recycling
,
and
so
on
.

The
industrial
countries
have
encountered
deep
evolution
of
their
strictures
since
the
car
has
been
made
available
to
everyone
.

At
the
beginning
of
the
last
Century
only
a
few
very
rich
people
could
afford
a
car
;
it
was
kind
of
leisure
or
sport
to
drive
one
.

Today
almost
everyone
owns
a
car
and
needs
it
for
daily
activities
.

The
transport
network
has
changed
according
to
this
social
evolution
.

The
increasing
number
of
cars
related
and
infrastructure
are
now
creeting
problems
.

A
lot
of
roads
and
motorways
are
overcrowded
,
and
enviromment
issues
are
more
and
more
related
to
the
intensive
use
of
cars
and
lorries
.

People
and
governments
are
concerned
about
how
to
limit
the
effects
of
cars
on
the
enviromment
without
impacting
their
mobility
.

This
will
be
a
tough
challenge
for
this
new
century
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
:

My
name
is
Juniper
,
I
am
helping
to
organise
the
conference
in
the
college
.

I
received
your
letter
the
other
day
and
I
am
writing
to
answer
your
questions
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
Palace
Hotel
which
is
not
very
far
from
the
place
where
the
conference
will
be
held
.

You
can
take
the
No.41
bus
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
,
it
only
takes
ten
minutes
approximately
.

As
for
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
it
will
be
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
starting
at
9:00
.

All
the
students
and
staffs
will
join
together
in
the
hall
.

They
can
play
games
and
talk
about
personal
experience
.

The
main
aim
of
it
is
to
deepen
the
friendship
among
all
these
pupils
coming
from
all
over
the
world
.

So
it
would
be
fine
if
you
wear
casual
clothes
and
look
smart
.

I
have
made
arrangement
for
the
afternoon
on
the
last
day
for
you
.

If
you
are
free
I
will
show
you
arround
our
college
.

You
can
visit
our
newly
-
built
science
lab
as
well
.

I
'm
sure
you
would
acquire
a
lot
of
knowledge
there
.

I
'm
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
.

Best
wishes
.

Best
choice

Welcome
to
London
.

You
asked
me
for
an
interesting
building
to
visit
.

In
my
opinion
,
I
'll
recommend
British
Museum
.

One
of
the
reasons
is
you
can
learn
almost
everything
about
British
history
there
.

The
museum
looks
very
old
as
some
other
buildings
in
London
,
but
it
is
very
modern
inside
.

After
going
through
the
enormous
main
door
,
you
can
see
a
huge
white
round
building
which
is
a
library
.

A
lot
of
famous
people
have
been
to
this
library
before
!

The
British
Hall
is
on
the
first
floor
,
not
far
from
the
library
.

It
shows
a
large
number
of
valuable
things
.

Almost
each
one
tells
you
a
story
or
gives
you
a
picture
about
British
history
.

I
'm
sure
all
the
students
will
gain
a
wonderful
lesson
!

Apart
from
the
national
history
,
there
are
more
content
about
the
past
of
the
world
.

You
can
go
to
many
sections
such
as
Asia
Hall
,
Egypt
Hall
,
Europe
Hall
and
so
on
.

Countless
fascinating
things
will
definely
take
you
the
whole
day
to
appreciate
.

After
a
visit
to
British
Museum
,
you
will
be
certainly
able
to
put
your
history
textbook
away
!

Also
you
do
n't
have
to
pay
any
money
for
it
,
and
the
transport
is
extremely
convenient
,
therefore
British
Museum
is
your
best
choice
.
Do
n't
be
hesitant
any
more
!

Dear
Mrs
Smith
.

I
am
writing
to
you
to
give
you
the
information
about
the
conference
.

The
hotel
your
group
has
been
booked
into
is
called
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
simple
to
find
the
way
from
this
hotel
to
the
conference
.

You
only
need
to
cross
the
street
in
front
of
your
hotel
.

There
you
will
find
a
modern
building
with
two
different
doors
a
red
and
a
blue
one
.

You
are
asked
to
take
the
blue
door
.

After
entering
you
will
see
the
signed
conference
room
.

We
organized
a
end
-
of
-
conference
party
on
the
day
before
your
departure
.

Everyone
is
welcome
to
join
this
party
to
get
to
know
each
other
in
a
good
atmosphere
.

You
should
wear
nice
and
comfortable
cloth
.

This
is
an
informal
party
.

I
suggest
you
visiting
the
old
part
of
Zurich
or
going
to
the
zoo
before
your
departure
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
at
the
conference
.

If
there
is
any
question
left
,
please
contact
me
.

Yours
sincerely
,

The
Most
Important
Invention

I
love
baking
cakes
,
cockies
and
breads
.

Baking
is
passion
and
in
the
town
I
live
I
'm
known
for
making
the
best
cakes
in
the
area
.

It
does
n't
matter
in
what
kind
of
mood
I
am
,
I
can
do
it
all
the
time
and
it
makes
me
feel
good
.

But
I
could
n't
bake
without
an
oven
.

I
'm
so
grateful
for
this
invention
which
allows
me
to
live
my
passion
.

I
think
the
oven
is
one
of
the
most
important
inventions
.

If
there
is
someone
who
does
n't
agree
with
me
,
he
or
she
should
try
to
live
one
month
without
using
the
oven
.

Besides
that
he
or
she
should
look
carefully
into
what
he
or
she
buys
.

I
'm
positive
that
after
such
an
experience
everyone
says
that
the
oven
is
a
really
important
invention
for
our
lifes
.

I
'm
thanking
the
person
who
invented
the
oven
.

Thank
you
!

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

I
am
writing
in
reply
to
your
letter
.

I
am
sorry
about
Richard
Brown
.

And
I
understand
that
you
need
help
,
so
that
I
will
help
you
as
far
as
I
can
.

Firstly
,
the
hotel
which
ha
been
booked
for
you
is
Palace
Hotel
that
is
located
close
to
the
conference
.

In
order
to
get
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
,
you
just
need
to
take
the
bus
we
will
offer
.

Secondly
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
take
place
in
the
same
hall
as
the
conference
at
6
p.m.
,
which
includes
dinner
and
an
announcement
by
the
president
of
the
conference
.

The
party
is
arranged
as
a
casual
party
,
therefore
,
you
can
wear
comfortable
clothes
.
You
can
expect
to
meet
many
students
from
other
schools
as
well
.

Finally
,
if
you
want
to
have
an
exciting
experience
in
here
,
I
strongly
suggest
that
you
go
to
the
musicals
.

As
you
may
hear
,
our
city
is
well
known
for
the
musicals
.

Or
,
If
you
want
to
relax
,
you
can
take
a
walk
in
the
park
situated
in
ten
minutes
distance
on
foot
from
the
hotel
.

Whatever
you
choose
,
you
will
be
satisfied
with
your
choice
.

If
you
have
more
questions
about
the
conference
and
something
else
,
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
me
.
I
would
be
glad
to
be
able
to
help
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Some
inventions
are
not
regarded
as
great
things
even
though
the
life
without
them
can
not
be
imagined
.

People
do
not
have
the
impression
on
important
inventions
any
more
,
because
they
have
been
getting
more
popular
and
common
.

However
,
there
is
something
which
is
still
believed
that
it
was
an
extreamly
important
invention
.

This
is
electricity
invented
by
Edison
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
the
reason
why
electricity
is
such
an
important
invention
is
that
most
of
machines
,
appliances
and
equipments
which
are
used
in
modern
times
can
be
operated
with
only
electricity
,
which
makes
people
not
to
too
much
phisical
labour
.

What
is
more
,
many
inventions
have
been
accelerated
by
electricity
.

In
my
life
,
I
use
electricity
in
many
different
ways
.

At
night
,
I
can
study
because
of
it
.
and
also
It
saves
my
time
which
would
be
used
up
for
doing
housework
such
as
laundry
,
cleaning
rooms
and
ironing
.

It
makes
my
life
more
convenient
than
that
without
it
.

To
sum
up
,
although
people
do
not
feel
that
electricity
is
a
great
invention
any
more
,
the
fact
that
electricity
is
one
of
the
most
important
inventions
in
the
world
will
not
be
changed
.

12th
June
2001

Dar
Mrs.
Maria
Smith
,

I
am
very
glad
to
help
you
about
the
International
Student
Conference
.

I
hope
that
our
friend
Richard
Brown
does
n't
have
any
serious
willness
.

Referent
,
where
is
the
conference
.

This
will
be
in
the
Casino
Hotel
and
we
do
n't
need
to
worry
for
the
best
way
because
in
all
the
main
routes
in
Devonport
have
signs
with
correct
way
to
the
popular
hotel
.

After
finish
the
conference
,
there
is
a
party
in
same
hotel
.

In
this
party
there
are
;
some
foods
,
soft
drinks
,
music
and
a
special
place
for
dancing
.

This
party
is
for
the
students
so
the
kinds
of
clouthes
wo
n't
be
so
formal
.

On
the
day
free
before
catch
our
plane
.

We
could
chouse
two
options
for
spending
our
free
time
.

One
is
a
guide
tour
on
center
city
,
and
another
is
visiting
the
chocolate
factory
.

Please
,
if
you
have
any
more
question
,
please
call
me
at
38755980
.

Yours
sincerely
,

I
can
live
without
this
.

It
's
true
.

In
our
lifes
,
may
be
,
could
n't
be
without
electricity
.

Some
people
can
live
without
this
,
but
I
am
sure
that
the
world
would
be
very
different
.

When
we
are
using
different
equipments
in
our
houses
,
we
are
using
the
electricity
.

Small
things
but
very
importants
in
our
lifes
.

For
example
:
T.V.
,
computer
,
just
light
and
a
long
list
that
now
I
can
not
write
.

I
do
n't
like
tinking
,
my
house
of
my
life
,
without
all
this
facilities
.

In
winter
when
is
dark
very
early
,
and
after
,
I
need
to
spent
my
free
time
in
home
.

What
I
can
do
without
my
music
and
my
computer
.

Now
,
just
you
need
to
think
that
you
would
do
or
what
would
happen
in
a
city
,
with
a
car
,
aeroplans
,
shoops
,
all
these
things
without
lights
.

Finally
.
I
think
that
everybody
know
that
the
electricity
is
very
important
invent
and
for
me
it
is
the
best
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

Thanks
for
your
last
letter
and
I
am
sorry
for
not
giving
you
enough
information
.

We
have
already
booked
a
4
stars
hotel
-
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
near
the
River
Thames
,
in
Walton
-
on
-
Thames
.

It
is
not
far
away
from
the
station
so
we
will
go
there
by
train
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
be
held
in
an
India
restaurant
,
that
is
next
to
the
hotel
.

It
is
surposed
to
be
held
during
7
pm
to
11
pm
.

Also
there
are
some
competitions
and
exciting
games
after
dinner
and
disco
is
also
provided
.

You
can
wear
anything
you
like
,
we
would
like
you
to
be
just
yourself
and
have
fun
.

As
you
know
,
our
area
is
quite
famous
and
lots
of
people
come
and
visit
it
every
year
.

There
are
so
many
things
to
do
,
unfortunately
,
there
is
just
3
hours
.

I
recommend
the
high
street
in
the
centre
of
our
area
because
it
is
quite
good
for
shopping
.

So
you
can
buy
gifts
for
your
friends
or
families
.

I
hope
I
have
given
you
enough
information
and
if
you
still
have
some
doubts
,
please
do
not
hestitate
to
contact
us
.

I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Nowadays
,
our
lives
is
becoming
better
and
better
.

Lots
of
great
inventions
has
been
invented
in
order
to
make
people
live
comfortablely
.

If
you
ask
me
which
is
the
greatest
invention
of
all
,
I
will
say
that
it
is
the
television
.

\"
Televisions
is
just
an
amazing
invention
.
\"
My
good
friend
said
that
.
I
agree
with
her
.

Firstly
,
televisions
make
us
know
more
about
the
world
without
travel
it
all
.

If
there
are
no
televisions
,
we
wo
n't
know
what
are
the
other
countries
like
,
or
even
what
language
they
speak
unless
we
go
to
that
country
.

Secondly
,
for
some
points
,
it
can
educate
young
children
.

Many
TV
programmes
are
especially
made
for
children
,
such
as
\"
Learn
follow
me
\"
and
\"
Be
good
to
others
\"
.

Actually
,
they
are
quite
good
programmes
and
helped
me
know
what
I
should
do
generally
or
how
to
behave
nicely
when
I
was
still
a
child
.

The
last
but
not
least
,
it
is
a
good
kind
of
entertainments
.

Maybe
you
will
think
that
playing
basketball
,
going
to
cinemas
and
discos
are
much
better
that
staying
at
home
sitting
in
front
of
an
object
.

However
,
televisions
can
bring
you
the
fun
that
other
activities
ca
n't
.

If
sometimes
I
do
n't
want
to
go
out
and
I
do
n't
want
to
be
lonely
,
that
's
easy
,
just
turn
on
the
television
and
enjoy
myself
.

However
,
everything
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
.

Personally
,
I
do
think
televisions
is
the
most
important
invention
.

Dear
Mrs.
Maria
Smith
.

I
got
your
letter
this
morning
and
I
am
very
pleased
to
give
you
some
information
.

As
I
know
,
he
booked
the
Palace
Hotel
in
downtown
.

When
you
go
to
the
conference
,
you
can
take
a
bus
or
a
taxi
.

But
if
you
have
enough
time
,
I
would
like
to
recommend
to
walk
.

Because
there
are
a
lot
of
beatiful
trees
and
you
can
see
the
sea
.

And
also
it
takes
just
fifteen
minutes
.

I
think
everybody
can
enjoy
it
.

By
the
way
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
is
a
kind
of
fairwell
party
.

There
will
be
three
parts
.

The
first
part
,
the
chairman
and
a
few
guests
will
have
a
speech
and
the
second
part
,
the
participacients
will
evaluate
themselves
,
and
the
the
last
part
it
will
provide
dinner
and
drinks
.

It
will
be
not
too
formal
party
.

So
you
can
wear
what
you
like
.

Moreover
,
I
would
like
to
recommend
'
City
tour
'
for
three
hours
.

Everybody
an
enjoy
themselves
.

It
is
£
12
each
and
there
is
a
reduction
for
groups
.

I
hope
it
will
be
a
good
tip
for
you
and
if
you
have
any
problem
,
you
can
contact
with
me
any
time
.

And
have
a
nice
time
in
my
town
and
send
my
regard
to
Richard
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Nowadays
there
are
a
lot
of
inventions
around
the
world
,
and
they
make
us
more
comfortable
and
convenient
.

Moreover
we
can
not
live
without
them
.

For
example
:
electricity
,
computer
,
telephon
,
boat
,
and
car
(
wheel
)
,
etc
.

None
of
them
are
unimportant
for
us
.

But
I
think
the
invention
of
electricity
is
the
most
important
thing
among
them
.

If
you
look
around
at
home
,
there
are
a
lot
of
electric
things
.

Electricity
could
be
able
to
invent
other
things
.

It
also
gave
us
more
free
time
,
especially
for
women
.

It
has
abosolutly
reduced
women
's
our
house
working
time
.

Evenmore
we
can
enjoy
our
night
with
lights
.

If
we
want
do
something
,
we
can
do
it
at
night
same
as
day
.

Finally
the
quality
of
our
life
is
changed
by
electricity
.

It
could
reduce
our
working
time
and
make
us
enjoyable
.

It
is
also
advancing
more
and
more
.

It
will
give
us
better
future
!

Have
you
ever
imagined
that
you
would
drive
electric
car
!

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
about
the
international
student
conference
.

Here
are
answers
for
your
questions
.

You
will
stay
in
the
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
situated
in
front
of
the
railway
station
,
Camberley
.

To
get
the
conference
,
you
catch
the
coach
No.7
from
the
station
and
get
off
at
the
Camberley
College
bus
stop
.

It
takes
5
minutes
from
the
station
.

When
you
get
here
,
just
turn
to
the
left
and
you
will
find
the
stadium
where
the
conference
will
be
held
.

The
end
-
of
-
conference
party
will
be
held
at
the
cafeteria
in
the
college
,
which
is
next
to
the
stadium
.

It
starts
at
18
p.m.
and
ends
at
22
pm
.

We
will
prepare
traditional
English
meals
and
some
students
from
foreign
country
will
prepare
their
ethnic
foods
.

There
is
a
museum
next
to
the
Camberley
Station
,
which
has
good
collection
of
paintings
and
potteries
,
and
it
would
be
a
good
place
for
you
to
spend
your
free
time
.

Instead
,
there
are
a
lot
of
shops
around
there
,
you
can
buy
souvenirs
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
meeting
you
.

Yours
sincerely
,

To
:
Student
from
the
United
States

From
:
Juli

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
describe
the
Haunted
Castle
in
Camberley
.

Place

This
castle
is
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
town
and
surrounded
by
woods
.

Inside
of
the
castle
is
always
dark
even
in
daytime
.

Story

It
is
500
years
old
,
and
it
is
said
to
be
haunted
by
a
lady
ghost
.

She
appears
occationaly
and
opens
every
window
in
the
castle
.

It
is
believed
that
she
was
a
nanny
who
worked
there
and
fell
out
of
the
window
.

People
said
she
was
seeking
something
and
still
seeking
even
if
she
had
dead
for
500
years
.

Conclusion

The
ghost
story
may
not
be
true
,
but
it
has
good
furniture
of
16th
century
,
and
the
castle
itself
is
very
beautiful
.

I
think
it
is
worth
while
to
see
.

I
hope
you
'll
enjoy
visiting
there
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
have
recieved
your
letter
this
morning
.

I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
Richard
is
ill
and
is
unable
to
attempt
the
conference
;
I
am
glad
that
you
are
able
to
be
the
leader
of
the
group
.

I
hope
that
these
informations
below
are
very
useful
to
you
,
during
your
attempt
of
conference
.

I
have
booked
a
hotel
not
far
off
from
our
school
.

The
hotel
is
called
Epsom
Down
Hotel
.

Your
plane
will
arrive
in
England
by
9:00
.

There
will
be
a
coach
waiting
for
you
,
and
the
driver
will
be
next
to
the
information
desk
.

You
should
arrive
at
the
hotel
by
11:00
.

You
will
than
have
an
hour
to
check
in
and
unpack
all
your
luggage
.

The
conference
will
start
on
time
at
12:30
,
so
I
would
suggest
you
to
leave
hotel
by
12:00
.

The
best
way
to
get
to
the
conference
is
to
follow
along
the
collage
road
and
turn
left
toward
the
end
,
you
than
keep
going
straight
,
you
will
eventually
see
the
main
entrance
of
the
collage
.

When
you
get
into
the
college
you
can
just
ask
any
boys
in
the
college
where
to
go
from
then
.

They
all
knows
where
the
conference
is
and
when
.

At
the
end
of
the
conference
,
we
will
have
a
party
.

The
party
is
to
let
all
the
students
to
know
each
other
better
.

The
party
will
be
in
the
dance
hall
next
to
the
conference
room
.

I
will
suggust
them
to
wear
formal
clothing
,
as
in
tie
,
trousers
and
blaser
.

For
the
afternoon
free
time
on
the
last
day
.

There
are
a
wide
variety
of
choices
that
they
can
do
.

They
can
play
tennis
,
do
athletics
,
swimming
...
and
many
other
sports
event
in
our
school
,
if
they
want
to
.

Or
they
can
also
visit
the
Epsom
Town
.

There
are
shops
which
sales
cloths
,
foods
,
and
books
...
They
can
decide
what
they
want
to
do
,
it
's
entirely
up
to
them
.

I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
and
hop
you
have
a
safe
flight
over
to
England
.

Your
sincerely
,

Dear
group
leader
,

Welcome
to
Taiwan
.

This
report
is
based
on
an
interesting
building
,
where
you
can
take
,
for
your
students
to
visit
.

This
building
is
situated
in
Taipei
,
the
capital
.

The
building
is
called
Chiang
Kei
-
shek
Momerial
Hall
.

Nearly
everyone
knows
where
this
building
is
,
so
if
you
have
a
chance
,
just
ask
the
local
people
in
Taipei
about
this
building
.

The
momerial
Hall
is
surrounded
by
large
playgrounds
.

As
you
go
into
the
main
Hall
,
you
will
see
a
huge
statue
of
Chiang
Kei
-
shek
,
this
is
because
the
building
is
the
rememberence
of
how
well
Chiang
did
in
History
.

The
statue
is
about
20
feet
high
.

Next
to
the
statue
is
protected
by
the
guards
,
the
guards
will
change
every
four
hours
.

Apart
from
the
main
Hall
,
there
are
also
lots
of
other
gallaries
.

In
these
gallaries
there
are
Historical
paintings
,
antique
furnitures
which
Chiang
used
.

These
treasure
are
very
old
,
even
older
than
the
history
of
America
.

All
these
treasures
were
brought
over
to
Taiwan
by
Chiang
during
the
defeat
in
China
.

They
are
all
been
well
look
after
.

As
well
as
all
the
treasures
,
statue
and
historical
paintings
...

There
are
also
restaurent
's
and
modern
gallaries
.

When
you
are
tired
after
looking
around
you
might
want
to
buy
drinks
or
something
to
eat
,
or
if
you
are
fed
up
with
historical
thing
,
you
migh
as
well
just
pop
into
the
modern
gallery
to
see
things
which
are
more
modern
.

Finally
,
if
you
went
to
visit
this
building
I
will
recommend
you
to
stay
at
a
hotel
not
far
from
the
momerial
Hall
called
Hyatt
Hotel
.

It
only
take
about
five
minutes
if
you
walk
.

I
hope
you
will
all
have
a
great
time
in
Taiwan
and
I
hope
you
will
enjoy
the
building
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
have
received
your
letter
dated
on
the
12th
june
2001
.

I
am
very
happy
to
help
you
and
I
hope
that
the
informations
,
that
I
am
going
to
give
you
,
will
be
enough
.

The
international
student
conference
will
be
in
the
Palace
Hotel
in
Lausanne
.

The
Hotel
is
a
big
building
in
the
middle
of
the
town
near
the
place
\"
St
-
François
\"
.

And
the
name
of
the
street
is
\"
Grand
-
Chêne
\"
.

You
can
not
miss
it
.

After
the
conference
,
we
are
going
to
stay
in
the
Palace
Hotel
but
instead
to
stay
in
the
conference
room
,
we
are
going
to
move
to
the
reception
room
where
a
dinner
will
be
prepared
for
us
.

Afterwards
,
a
live
band
are
going
to
play
the
rest
of
the
night
.

For
the
clothes
,
you
have
to
wear
something
smart
and
classic
.

If
you
want
to
stay
in
Lausanne
during
your
afternoon
free
,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
go
to
Ouchy
.

There
,
you
can
enjoy
the
Landscape
and
have
a
sunbath
.

Your
sincerely
,

OLYMPIQUE
MUSEUM

The
aim
of
this
report
is
to
give
further
informations
on
an
interesting
building
to
visit
in
Lausanne
.

It
is
based
on
my
own
experience
.

WHY
THE
OLYMPIC
MUSEUM
.

The
Olympique
Museum
is
situated
near
the
lake
and
offer
,
for
the
tourist
,
an
unbelievable
view
on
the
mountains
and
the
lake
.

But
also
,
the
museum
have
a
lot
of
gardens
with
several
statues
.

Besides
,
the
architecture
of
the
building
is
beautiful
and
very
modern
.

First
of
all
,
the
main
interest
of
the
museum
is
the
olympic
history
.

You
can
find
a
lot
of
documentary
about
it
and
you
have
several
competitors
personal
objects
.

In
addition
,
you
can
play
with
several
interactive
game
and
learn
about
the
rules
of
the
olympic
games
.

REASONS
OF
RECOMMENDATION
.

The
principal
reason
is
the
cheapest
price
.

You
pay
only
to
FRS
for
the
entry
and
you
can
stay
in
all
the
time
that
you
want
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
are
more
than
10
people
,
you
can
have
a
group
price
and
pay
only
6
Frs
per
person
.

It
seems
that
this
solution
might
be
the
best
way
to
visit
this
museum
.

CONCLUSION
.

To
sum
up
,
the
Olympic
Museum
is
a
very
attractive
place
and
could
be
a
good
trip
with
your
family
or
your
student
group
.

Therefore
,
if
you
want
to
learn
something
about
the
Olympic
Games
,
it
must
be
the
best
place
for
this
.

Dear
Maria
,

I
'm
so
happy
to
help
you
for
this
international
student
conference
.

I
'm
afraid
for
Richard
.

Could
you
please
tell
him
my
best
wishes
of
health
?

I
'm
sure
you
can
perfectly
replace
it
to
lead
your
group
.

At
first
,
you
should
know
that
you
are
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
that
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
town
.

The
access
to
the
conference
place
is
very
easy
.

First
of
all
,
you
must
walk
down
to
the
Central
Street
until
you
arrive
at
the
bus
stop
,
then
you
take
the
bus
number
two
that
goes
directly
to
the
college
.

After
the
conference
,
there
is
a
great
party
that
is
organised
by
friends
.

It
starts
at
twenty
o'clock
until
the
end
of
the
night
,
so
be
ready
!

There
is
no
special
thema
for
the
wearing
style
but
it
should
be
more
fun
if
you
wear
something
crazy
...

Finally
,
I
propose
you
to
go
to
the
new
college
swimmingpool
on
the
last
day
afternoon
.

Every
body
will
go
there
.

I
hope
you
will
have
fun
!

Yours
sincerely

Hello
,

I
will
give
you
some
informations
on
the
yverdon
's
castle
.

This
building
is
one
of
the
oldest
that
stays
in
the
landscape
of
the
town
.

I
think
its
important
to
see
it
when
you
come
there
because
it
shows
us
how
the
town
had
been
developped
around
it
since
its
creation
.

Those
days
,
the
castle
is
being
remade
,
so
there
is
a
lot
of
construction
engines
around
it
.

That
's
not
a
big
problem
because
there
is
a
complete
museum
in
it
where
you
can
see
old
pictures
of
the
castle
during
the
centuries
.

There
is
a
lot
of
old
items
that
were
in
the
King
's
family
.

You
should
have
probably
heard
about
the
mummy
who
sleeps
there
for
about
two
thousand
years
...
You
can
see
it
in
the
dungeon
.

So
you
can
visit
everywhere
you
want
with
or
without
a
guide
.

I
hope
you
will
enjoy
the
visit
and
I
wish
you
a
nice
holliday
in
Yverdon
.

Best
regards
,

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
will
try
my
best
to
answer
the
questions
.

First
of
all
,
we
have
already
booked
the
Five
-
Stars
Hotel
for
your
group
.

It
is
a
modern
hotel
,
near
our
college
,
and
it
is
also
very
convenent
to
come
from
the
airport
.
You
can
take
both
by
buses
or
taxies
.

The
nember
101
bus
starts
from
the
airport
,
than
you
can
get
off
from
\"
city
college
\"
stop
.

It
would
be
a
great
chance
to
tark
part
in
the
party
for
everyone
.

This
is
just
a
relaxing
party
,
just
for
the
members
have
a
chance
to
relax
and
make
friends
.

So
I
think
you
'd
better
to
wear
a
dress
.

Finally
,
about
the
free
three
hours
,
my
personal
prefer
to
go
shopping
.

Our
city
has
got
the
biggest
shoping
centre
in
South
England
,
there
gathers
so
many
shops
.

It
worthes
tp
spend
time
and
money
on
that
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
!

Yours
sincerely

Nowdays
people
have
become
used
to
watching
televesion
's
programs
everyday
.

The
TV
is
so
important
that
you
can
see
it
in
every
family
,
and
it
is
a
essential
equipment
for
everyone
.

First
of
al
,
in
my
opinion
,
TV
has
a
great
education
functions
,
and
also
makes
the
world
become
small
.

You
can
just
sit
at
home
then
you
can
know
what
is
happening
all
over
the
world
at
the
moment
.

I
would
rather
watching
the
news
on
TV
in
stead
of
reading
in
newspaper
or
hearing
on
radio
because
the
news
on
TV
are
vivid
.

Moreover
,
the
TV
is
a
great
company
for
the
people
who
live
alone
or
feel
alone
.
I
would
like
to
open
TV
when
I
stay
at
home
.

Someone
are
talking
,
laughting
,
crying
on
there
,
so
join
them
,
you
will
feel
much
better
than
just
yourself
.

Some
TV
programs
are
enjouable
!

However
,
TV
also
has
some
disadvantages
.

You
might
just
sitting
in
front
of
TV
for
hours
learn
nothing
,
or
no
more
talk
with
your
family
.

I
think
this
is
the
badest
influence
in
the
society
.

In
clucsion
,
the
TV
has
both
advantages
and
disagvangtages
,
but
on
the
whole
advantages
is
greater
than
disadvantages
.

So
,
but
on
the
whole
,
TV
still
is
a
wonderful
and
important
invention
on
the
world
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

I
am
writing
to
you
to
give
you
more
informations
about
an
international
student
conference
.

The
group
has
been
booked
into
King
Hotel
at
High
Street
which
is
very
easy
to
find
.

And
the
best
way
to
get
from
there
to
the
conference
is
following
the
rod
in
front
of
the
hotel
to
the
right
,
then
cross
the
zebra
crossing
to
the
opposite
side
.

After
that
walk
to
the
right
about
15
metres
and
you
will
find
the
conference
place
which
is
called
White
House
.

At
the
end
of
conference
,
we
are
going
to
have
an
International
Dinner
as
well
as
some
shows
from
the
students
in
my
college
.

As
this
is
a
special
conference
so
you
could
wear
your
own
national
dress
to
present
your
country
.

Finally
,
on
the
last
day
you
could
spend
your
free
time
to
visit
our
town
hall
which
you
will
be
able
to
learn
more
about
my
area
-
or
do
some
shopping
at
High
Street
.

If
you
want
more
information
,
please
contact
me
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
soon
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Mr.
Bill
,

I
am
writing
to
give
an
information
on
a
very
interesting
building
to
visit
.

It
is
called
Penrhyh
Castle
,
as
the
building
will
tell
you
all
about
Wales
.

On
the
positive
side
,
you
and
the
group
will
be
abe
to
learn
more
about
Welsh
art
works
which
are
presented
on
the
wall
,
on
the
door
and
some
furnitures
.

The
building
itself
looks
splendid
and
beautiful
.

On
the
other
hand
,
you
might
find
something
which
is
very
boring
such
as
walking
along
the
old
wooden
floor
which
causes
some
noise
.

And
some
old
toilets
might
look
awlful
.

But
in
my
recommendation
,
I
think
it
would
be
nice
for
the
students
to
come
and
see
this
building
.

Because
they
will
be
able
to
learn
and
compare
with
the
place
in
their
country
.

As
Wales
is
not
modern
like
America
,
so
the
students
will
probably
get
the
idea
of
looking
back
to
the
old
things
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith
.

I
was
really
pleased
to
receive
at
your
letter
.

Unfortunately
Richard
Brown
is
ill
but
I
can
help
you
as
much
as
I
can
.

So
,
I
'm
writting
to
reply
for
giving
all
the
information
you
asked
for
.

Firstly
,
we
've
booked
Palace
Hotel
,
which
is
located
in
Central
.

The
best
way
to
get
from
the
hotel
to
the
conference
its
using
tube
because
it
takes
only
20
mininute
.

The
tube
is
2
line
which
is
red
colour
.

And
your
speach
would
be
better
for
the
end
of
conference
party
.

I
'd
suggest
you
to
wear
at
least
,
semi
formal
wears
such
as
a
jacket
with
another
clothes
.

Finally
,
I
give
you
some
suggestions
which
could
spend
for
about
3
hours
in
the
national
museum
in
my
area
.

The
museum
can
be
helpful
to
understand
our
country
's
history
and
art
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
soon
.

Yours
sincerely
,

Computer
is
the
most
important
invention
in
our
life
.

Some
people
might
say
the
electricity
more
important
than
another
thingh
.

It
's
hard
to
say
which
is
the
most
important
invention
.

However
,
I
'd
say
computer
is
more
amazing
invention
rather
than
another
inventions
such
as
the
telephone
,
the
car
.

Recently
computer
is
really
necessary
and
we
ca
n't
manage
to
work
without
them
.

Not
only
is
for
bussiness
,
but
also
in
for
my
life
.

For
instance
,
when
I
want
to
contanct
with
to
my
friend
,
it
's
quite
helpful
by
using
e
-
mail
.

Before
computer
had
been
invented
,
we
could
n't
possibly
have
lots
of
information
easily
and
we
could
n't
contact
with
to
foreign
countries
at
the
same
time
.

And
also
it
's
time
to
make
new
system
which
makes
us
use
easier
and
more
simple
,
so
far
more
people
can
enjoy
computer
more
than
before
.

Despite
amazing
invention
,
some
times
computer
makes
big
problem
,
such
as
millennium
bug
(
some
people
called
\"
2000
problem
\"
)
,
because
computer
not
flexible
enough
like
a
human
's
brain
.

However
,
computer
is
worth
to
use
in
our
life
until
more
coveniance
machine
will
be
invented
.

Dear
Mrs.
Smith
,

Thank
you
for
your
letter
.

I
am
very
pleased
to
give
you
the
information
you
requested
.

We
are
holding
the
conference
party
at
the
Royal
Lancaster
Hotel
-
banqueting
room
at
2.00
pm
on
Sat
.

24
June
.

The
nearest
tube
station
is
Lancaster
Gate
.

As
you
know
,
we
've
been
working
very
hard
all
this
term
.

So
we
've
decided
at
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
we
will
have
a
buffet
and
a
disco
party
.

Our
students
,
then
will
get
to
know
each
other
well
.

I
would
suggest
everybody
to
wear
a
casual
dresses
.

Finally
,
I
would
recommend
you
and
your
group
to
enjoy
shopping
and
sightseeing
around
Oxford
Street
and
nearby
.

I
look
forward
to
see
you
and

.

Your
Sincerely

From

Re
:
The
Barbican
Centre
.

As
you
requested
which
is
the
interesting
building
to
visit
.
I
would
strongly
recommend
the
Barbican
Centre
building
in
the
city
.

It
located
in
the
city
and
the
nearest
tube
station
is
Moorgate
Station
.

The
Barbican
Centre
built
in
1975
.

Apart
from
Banks
and
important
offices
.

There
are
also
world
stock
market
exchange
,
an
opera
theatre
,
shopping
arcades
,
books
and
records
stores
.

It
also
held
an
internation
exhibition
all
year
round
.

Recently
,
the
exhibition
of
africa
just
finished
.

The
opening
time
starts
from
7.30
AM
.
till
late
at
night
when
the
theatre
is
closed
.

The
building
is
huge
with
high
technology
and
construction
and
a
tight
security
.

It
upgraded
the
building
every
year
.

The
Barbican
Centre
is
a
very
important
building
in
London
.

You
and
your
group
will
visit
one
building
which
has
so
many
places
in
this
building
.

So
that
you
can
spend
your
time
in
one
go
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith

Thank
you
for
your
letter
which
arrived
me
this
morning
.

Of
course
it
is
a
pity
that
Mr.
Brown
has
been
ill
,
but
we
are
happy
that
you
are
comeing
now
.

You
asked
me
which
hotel
the
group
had
been
booked
.

It
is
the
Palace
hotel
,
about
a
mile
away
where
the
conference
will
take
place
.

The
best
way
to
get
there
,
is
to
take
the
bus
number
7
.

The
bus
stop
is
opposite
the
entrance
of
the
hotel
.

You
will
leave
the
bus
at
,
,
Royal
gardens
\"
.

Turn
left
and
go
straight
to
,
,
Baker
street
\"
At
the
need
of
this
street
there
is
the
house
number
18
.

This
is
our
college
.

You
wish
to
know
all
about
,
,
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
.

As
far
as
I
can
see
there
will
be
only
a
little
dinner
and
a
group
of
young
singers
will
surprise
us
by
their
songs
.

Moreover
you
asked
what
to
wear
.
Do
not
bother
.

I
would
recommend
you
wearing
some
casual
clothes
,
like
a
jeans
,
a
blouse
or
a
skirt
and
a
jacket
.

Donnot
forget
to
wear
a
pair
of
comfortable
shoes
,
because
you
will
not
have
chance
to
change
it
.

Finally
I
give
you
some
advise
for
what
you
could
do
for
about
three
hours
.

Firstly
we
have
a
nice
and
interesting
museum
,
it
is
located
near
the
hotel
.

Furthemore
there
is
the
zoo
with
a
lot
of
different
animals
,
located
to
walk
within
five
minutes
.

Lastly
there
is
also
a
very
old
and
famous
church
,
with
many
coloured
windows
.

For
further
information
please
call
me
up
.
I
hope
you
will
have
an
interesting
conference
here
.

I
am
looking
forward
seeing
you

Yours
sincerely

The
telephone
a
very
important
invention

In
my
early
childhood
my
mother
said
to
me
that
when
she
has
been
a
litte
girl
there
has
been
only
one
telephone
in
the
house
where
she
had
lived
.

It
has
been
in
her
parents
'
appartement
.

The
neighbours
had
come
into
to
make
their
calls
and
to
get
their
calls
.

Todays
nobody
could
imagine
such
a
situation
.

In
every
household
there
is
a
telephone
at
least
.

There
are
a
lot
of
advantages
for
it
.

Firstly
people
are
able
to
talk
to
person
on
every
time
.
Be
it
:
just
for
fun
or
also
to
discuss
some
important
and
relevant
thins
.

Moreover
we
always
can
call
for
help
to
the
police
,
to
the
hospital
or
to
a
doctor
.

This
could
save
life
!

An
other
advantage
is
that
all
offices
,
firms
and
industries
could
not
further
exist
without
it
.

Of
course
there
is
also
a
big
disadvantage
.

All
people
know
this
situation
;
people
want
not
to
be
interrupted
,
maybe
they
are
reading
a
book
,
having
a
good
talk
or
are
having
a
little
sleep
...
then
the
telephone
rings
...
!

It
is
not
an
easy
desicion
how
to
react
now
.

Being
sincere
,
most
of
us
would
go
to
the
telephone
.

Another
point
of
disadvantage
is
that
the
mobile
phones
are
ringing
.
everywhere
and
on
every
time
.

Especially
youngsters
misuse
this
kind
of
invention
.

To
sum
up
this
invention
is
one
of
the
most
useful
things
.

It
is
always
the
same
how
to
people
use
it
or
not
and
how
people
handle
it
.

Dear
Mrs
Maria
Smith

thankyou
for
your
letter
,
wich
arrived
yesterday
.

I
hope
to
give
you
,
all
the
information
need
and
please
,
if
you
want
more
information
or
somenthing
is
not
clear
,
please
do
n't
esitate
to
contact
me
again
.

The
Hotel
is
near
the
station
and
is
call
\"
Grand
Placad
\"
.

When
you
arrived
you
take
the
train
for
Guildford
and
after
you
have
just
across
the
road
,
in
front
of
the
station
.

It
's
very
confortable
hotel
where
you
can
find
everything
you
need
.

From
there
to
the
conference
you
have
to
take
the
bus
number
50
,
that
stop
near
the
hotel
and
arrive
in
town
center
.

The
conference
is
organised
in
the
civic
hall
so
it
is
very
simple
to
found
it
.

At
the
end
of
conference
there
is
a
party
a
perfect
opportunity
for
your
students
meet
new
friends
from
all
part
of
word
and
they
could
speak
about
their
experience
.

I
suggest
for
that
conference
to
wear
somenthing
very
confortable
but
elegant
,
the
organisation
want
for
all
boys
wear
jacket
,
the
tie
is
not
necessary
.

I
do
n't
know
rely
what
you
can
see
,
three
hours
I
think
is
not
enough
but
near
the
station
there
is
a
beautiful
garden

interesting
building
to
visit
in

There
are
plenty
of
churchs
,
cathedrals
,
and
olds
cotages
.

The
churchs
and
the
cathedral
are
very
intesting
because
of
their
differents
romanics
styles
.

I
suggest
you
visit
first
the
cathedral
of
\"
Le
Seu
d'Mrgell
\"

the
most
emblematic
building
in
the

Dear
Mrs
Smith
,

In
replied
of
your
letter
,
I
will
try
to
give
you
some
advices
.

Concerning
the
hotel
,
the
group
has
been
booked
into
the
Palace
Hotel
.

The
conference
will
take
place
not
far
from
the
hotel
so
you
will
see
indications
to
follow
.

For
the
conference
,
I
suggest
you
to
wear
a
beautiful
dress
,
because
there
will
be
important
persons
of
others
colleges
.

At
the
end
of
the
conference
,
all
students
and
leader
will
have
a
drink
.

To
finish
,
if
you
have
spare
time
,
you
could
walk
on
the
center
of
Poitiers
which
is
very
beautiful
.

I
hope
I
give
you
enough
details
.

I
look
forward
to
meeting
you
on
the
conference
.

Yours
faithfully
,

The
building
called
in
French
\"
Le
Centre
Pompidou
\"
is
a
very
surprising
monument
.

It
's
a
modern
building
with
an
architecture
that
you
ca
n't
see
in
other
place
.

What
is
impressive
on
this
building
is
the
number
of
tubes
that
you
can
see
outside
and
inside
the
building
.

On
the
Pompidou
's
center
,
there
are
different
expositions
on
different
themes
.

In
general
,
there
are
paintings
,
videos
and
sculptures
.

This
expositions
are
often
very
attractive
and
they
change
every
year
.

Another
good
point
,
if
you
go
there
you
will
have
an
extraordinary
view
on
the
city
.

So
if
you
visit
Paris
,
the
Pompidou
's
center
is
a
very
interesting
building
to
visit
,
even
if
in
Paris
there
are
many
others
buildings
.

Dear
Mrs
Smith
.

I
am
writing
in
response
to
your
letter
in
order
to
give
you
some
further
information
about
the
international
student
conference
in
our
college
.

I
would
like
to
inform
you
that
your
group
has
been
booked
into
Palace
Hotel
.

It
is
situated
in
the
center
of
our
town
and
it
takes
five
minutes
to
get
to
the
college
,
where
the
conference
is
going
to
be
held
.

I
think
that
the
best
choise
for
you
is
to
take
the
234
bus
.

The
bus
stop
you
should
get
off
is
called
\"
The
Green
Man
\"
.

With
reference
to
the
end
-
of
-
conference
party
,
which
is
going
to
take
place
on
Tuesday
from
8:00
until
midnight
,
I
would
like
to
mention
the
necessary
dress
code
.

It
is
an
evening
dress
for
women
and
black
trousers
,
a
white
shirt
and
a
black
bow
tie
for
men
.

Lastly
,
I
would
like
to
give
you
some
suggestions
about
way
in
which
you
can
spend
your
free
time
in
our
town
.

I
am
strongly
convinced
,
that
you
should
visit
local
Science
Museum
.

Also
there
is
a
very
good
shopping
center
next
to
the
museum
.

I
look
forward
to
seeing
your
at
the
conference
and
hope
that
you
will
have
a
good
time
in
our
town
.

Yours
sincerely

As
it
is
widely
known
,
lots
of
different
and
important
things
were
invented
during
the
20th
century
,
nevertheless
I
believe
that
the
most
important
one
is
the
computer
.

It
is
a
fact
,
that
the
modern
society
have
created
the
demand
for
the
ability
to
cope
with
the
vast
amounts
of
information
.

Taking
it
into
consideration
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
computer
is
the
priceless
invention
for
an
accountants
,
designers
,
engineers
and
so
on
and
on
.

Another
point
in
favour
is
the
possibility
to
connect
to
the
Internet
.

It
allows
you
to
have
all
the
necessary
information
\"
on
your
fingertips
\"
.

Also
not
least
importantly
is
the
role
of
computers
in
the
process
of
production
in
factories
around
the
world
.

On
the
other
hand
there
are
some
disadvantages
.

For
instance
a
lot
of
children
nowadays
replace
their
real
life
with
the
virtual
world
,
which
computers
create
.

Another
drawback
is
that
in
industry
computers
replace
people
's
labour
,
which
leads
to
the
increasing
of
unemployment
.

To
conclude
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
goverments
of
all
developed
countries
would
n't
have
been
so
concerned
about
so
-
called
\"
problem
2000
\"
if
the
computer
had
not
been
so
important
for
the
modern
society
.

Neuchâtel
,
12th
June
2001

Dear

I
thank

illness
.

I

Your

the
Palace
Hotel

which

of
the

.

To
go
to
the
conference

is
really
easy
.

You
have
to
take
the
bus
number
1
and
get
off
at
\"
Black

\"
,
which
is
the
third

.

After
the

at

pm
.
a
party
is
organised
.

During
it
,

their
famous

clothes
,
required
for
the
party
are
suits
for
men
and
cocktail

Before

have
time
to
visit
the
Olympic
Museum
or
to
make
a
sightseeing
tour
in
our
city
.

I
hope
you
will
enjoy
your
journey

Report
on
the
\"
Paintings
Museum
\"

In
order
to
write
this
report
,
I
spent
hours
in
this
wonderful
museum
.

There
,
I
saw
the
exibitions
and
admired
the
building
itself
.

I
walked
around
the
garden
too
.

Location

The
museum
is
located
in
Ouchy
,
in
front
of
the
\"
Delamuraz
Hotel
\"
.

It
is
close
to
the
main
road
,
and
at
300
meters
of
the
station
.

Outside

The
building
is
made
of
white
stones
.

It
has
two
floors
.

Before
going
inside
,
you
have
to
pas
through
the
huge
garden
.

There
,
ponds
,
pools
,
trees
,
flowers
and
ducks
can
be
admired
.

I
recommend
you
to
take
your
swim
suit
,
because
in
summer
,
it
is
allowed
to
swim
in
pools
.

Inside

When
you
are
inside
the
museum
,
you
will
be
impressed
by
the
paintings
on
the
walls
.

There
were
all
painting
during
the
war
by
nurses
.

If
you
go
down
a
few
steps
,
you
will
discover
the
ceilar
.

Everything
in
this
room
is
about
wine
.

To
learn
the
whole
history
of
the
building
,
there
is
a
room
dedicated
to
it
on
the
first
floor
.

I
particularly
recommend
you
to
visit
the
\"
blue
\"
room
.

Everything
in
this
room
is
blue
,
the
carpet
,
the
ceiling
and
even
the
door
.

According
to
the
owner
,
it
was
a
room
where
in
the
past
people
used
to
go
when
they
were
depressed
.

Conclusion

To
sum
up
,
I
would
like
to
add
that
this
house
is
the
most
famous
in
our
city
.

You
should
come
and
visit
it
for
the
paintings
or
for
the
building
itself
.

You
wo
n't
be
disappointed
.

The
only
negative
point
is
that
you
have
to
pay
10
francs
to
visit
.
the
house
and
the
garden
.
