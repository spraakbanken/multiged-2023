Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
sad	c
to	c
read	c
about	c
Richard	c
not	c
being	c
at	i
his	i
best	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
he	c
will	c
recover	c
soon	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
will	c
make	c
it	c
to	c
our	c
conference	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
organisation	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
adequate	i
number	c
of	c
double	c
rooms	c
with	c
shower	c
or	c
bath	c
have	c
been	c
booked	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
hotel	i
located	c
across	c
the	c
main	c
street	c
from	c
the	c
train	c
station	c
.	c

To	c
come	c
to	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
either	c
watch	i
downhill	c
to	c
the	c
lake	i
front	i
(	c
about	c
10	c
min	i
)	c
or	c
take	c
the	c
new	c
cable	c
car	c
from	c
the	c
train	c
station	c
.	c

The	c
college	c
is	c
just	c
stairs	i
away	c
from	c
the	c
bottom	c
end	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
a	c
boat	c
cruising	c
on	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
start	c
by	i
a	c
speech	c
from	c
the	c
Director	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

The	c
recreative	i
part	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
10	c
pm	c
with	c
a	c
short	c
musical	c
comedy	c
performed	c
by	c
some	c
of	c
our	c
students	c
and	c
end	c
with	c
fireworks	c
launched	c
from	c
the	c
roof	c
of	c
the	c
college	c
at	c
2	c
am	c
.	c

As	c
nights	c
may	c
be	c
cold	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
take	c
with	c
you	c
a	c
pullover	c
.	c

Appart	i
of	i
that	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
recommendation	c
as	c
to	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Depending	c
on	c
the	c
interests	c
of	c
your	c
students	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
visit	c
the	c
internet	c
site	c
of	c
the	c
tourist	c
office	c
:	c
www.neuchatel.ch	c
.	c

yours	i
sincerely	c

Where	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

is	c
very	c
often	c
the	c
first	c
question	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
asked	c
when	c
answering	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Why	c
?	c

Because	c
somebody	c
has	c
invented	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
communication	c
device	c
ever	c
.	c

The	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

Once	c
heavy	c
,	c
expensive	c
and	c
not	c
reliable	c
,	c
the	c
new	c
mobile	c
phone	c
fits	c
in	c
almost	c
any	c
pocket	c
and	c
is	c
given	c
away	c
by	c
the	c
operator	c
to	c
attract	c
new	c
customers	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

communication	c
has	c
changed	c
,	c
not	c
improved	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
allows	c
to	i
be	c
reached	c
everywhere	c
(	c
even	c
in	c
places	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
.	i
)	i

For	c
rescue	c
teams	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
.	c

But	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
handicap	c
outside	c
professional	c
life	c
.	c

Should	c
n't	c
people	c
communicate	c
with	c
those	c
they	c
are	c
next	c
to	c
instead	c
of	c
calling	c
someone	c
2	c
miles	c
away	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
rare	c
to	c
see	c
two	c
people	c
walking	c
side	c
by	c
side	c
,	c
both	c
talking	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Would	c
n't	c
it	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
shopping	c
list	c
instead	c
of	c
dialing	i
home	c
to	c
ask	c
which	c
salad	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Mobile	i
phone	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
invention	c
but	c
as	c
for	i
cigarettes	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
right	i
on	c
it	c

CAUTION	c
:	c
use	c
of	c
this	c
device	c
may	c
damage	c
your	c
brain	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
me	i
on	c
10	c
June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	NA
that	c
the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
Palace	i
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
locates	i
beside	c
the	c
congress	c
house	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
make	c
contact	c
with	c
Mrs	c
Brackenbury	c
using	c
the	c
number	c
06	c
8793888	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
from	i
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
specially	c
organized	c
by	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
bus	c
leaves	c
at	c
8:00	c
every	c
morning	c
and	c
gets	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
at	c
6	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Off	i
course	c
there	c
's	c
also	c
a	c
bus	i
number	i
8	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	i
also	c
suitable	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
leaves	c
only	c
every	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
which	c
happens	i
in	c
the	c
evening	c
on	c
20	c
June	c
,	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
the	c
coast	c
.	c

Beside	c
the	c
barbecue	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
some	c
well	c
-	c
known	c
student	c
bands	c
from	c
our	c
country	c
are	i
performing	i
music	c
through	c
the	c
whole	c
night	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
is	c
,	NA
that	c
there	c
's	c
a	c
Latin	c
music	c
band	c
coming	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
party	c
more	c
colourful	c
.	c

It	c
plays	i
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
11:00	c
,	c
while	c
the	c
students	c
can	c
enjoy	c
it	c
with	c
dancing	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
events	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
will	c
end	i
up	i
at	c
about	c
12:30	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
is	c
just	c
something	c
casual	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
museums	c
,	i
markets	c
(	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
robot	c
-	c
market	c
)	c
.	c

Basically	c
it	c
's	c
a	NA
free	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
to	c
look	c
round	c
here	c
by	c
themselves	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	c
questions	c
re	i
answered	c
appropriatly	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
on	i
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Computer	c
Life	c

Now	i
-	i
a	i
-	i
day	i
computer	i
can	c
be	c
found	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
corner	c
,	c
in	c
offices	c
,	c
in	c
shops	c
.	c

Or	i
even	i
in	i
cars	i
and	i
washmachines	i
there	i
're	i
computer	i
chips	i
.	c

What	i
has	i
computer	i
affected	c
to	NA
our	c
life	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
efficiency	c
of	c
the	NA
society	c
has	c
been	c
improved	c
.	c

When	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wait	c
the	i
Kasse	i
to	c
take	c
every	c
article	c
's	c
note	c
by	c
hand	c
.	c

When	c
booking	c
a	c
airline	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
just	c
simply	NA
make	c
a	c
phone	c
to	i
any	c
agency	c
,	c
and	c
get	c
it	c
done	c
in	c
one	c
minute	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
looking	c
up	c
tons	c
of	c
books	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
information	c
what	i
we	c
need	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
very	c
easily	c
search	c
it	i
from	i
internet	i
or	c
on	c
the	c
local	c
network	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	NA
very	c
often	c
heard	c
,	NA
that	c
someone	c
,	NA
who	c
has	c
a	c
special	i
illness	c
,	NA
gets	i
operations	i
by	i
a	c
foreign	c
institutes	i
,	NA
which	c
he	c
find	i
via	c
internet	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
with	c
computer	c
network	i
,	c
it	c
can	i
be	i
possible	c
that	i
people	c
work	i
from	c
home	c
,	c
making	c
projects	c
,	c
controling	i
operations	c
or	c
having	c
conferences	c
.	c

Lastly	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
communications	c
has	c
been	NA
also	c
changed	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
the	NA
tranditional	i
telecommunication	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
,	i
mail	i
or	c
even	c
see	c
each	c
other	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
computer	i
network	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
're	c
also	c
some	c
aspects	c
in	c
which	c
the	NA
computer	c
technology	c
need	i
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
reading	c
on	c
the	c
screen	c
is	c
still	c
not	c
as	c
comfortable	c
as	c
on	i
papers	i
.	c

A	c
very	c
important	c
and	c
severe	c
problem	c
is	c
the	NA
reliability	c
and	c
security	c
.	c

Till	i
now	i
,	c
to	i
completely	i
rely	i
on	i
computer	i
is	i
still	i
somehow	i
not	i
safe	i
enough	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
computer	i
have	c
become	c
a	c
very	NA
essential	NA
necessity	c
of	i
our	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
still	c
a	c
young	c
invention	c
,	c
which	c
need	i
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c

First	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
about	c
Richard	c
illness	i
.	c

Please	c
remember	c
me	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
give	c
him	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c
.	c

About	i
your	c
request	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
must	i
need	c
,	i
however	i
you	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
,	i
(	i
my	i
phone	c
number	c
is	c
2496	c
9731	c
)	i
.	i

Your	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wellkown	i
hotel	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
well	c
-	NA
located	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
move	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

Even	i
more	i
the	c
conference	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Exhibition	c
Centre	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
located	c
only	c
five	c
minutes	c
walking	i
far	NA
from	c
the	c
Hotel	i
.	c

We	c
haven't	c
asked	c
for	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
can	c
come	c
well	c
-	NA
dressed	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
better	c
.	i

After	c
the	c
conference	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
informal	c
dinner	c
with	c
a	c
previous	c
snack	c
time	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
introduce	c
each	i
others	i
.	c

Finally	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
the	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
you	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
hours	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

\"	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
building	c
in	c
Barcelona	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
can	i
like	c
whatever	c
your	c
tastes	c
are	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
the	c
\"	c
Sagrada	c
Familia	c
\"	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
big	i
number	c
of	c
choices	c
,	c
this	c
unfinished	c
church	c
offers	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
view	c
fro	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
its	c
towers	c
,	c
a	c
charming	c
story	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
representative	c
examples	c
of	c
the	NA
Catalonia	i
modernisme	i
art	c
.	c

Gaudi	c
conceived	c
this	i
church	c
n	i
1912	c
,	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
until	c
1920	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
build	c
it	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
beginning	c
the	c
work	c
was	i
interrupted	c
in	i
different	c
periods	i
and	c
started	c
again	c
.	c

After	c
Gaudi	c
death	i
it	c
was	c
critical	c
stop	c
which	c
was	c
fortunately	c
solved	c
three	c
years	c
later	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
a	NA
hard	c
work	c
is	c
being	c
done	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
finish	c
as	i
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

The	c
visitor	c
can	c
wonder	i
around	c
all	i
the	i
building	c
or	c
follow	c
a	c
guided	c
visit	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	i
exhibition	c
room	c
where	c
maps	c
and	c
projects	i
can	c
be	c
consulted	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
unless	c
you	c
suffer	c
from	c
your	i
heart	c
,	i
you	c
should	c
climb	c
the	c
350	c
steps	c
which	c
carry	c
you	c
to	c
the	c
top	c
.	c

There	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
a	c
terrific	c
view	c
,	i
not	i
only	c
will	c
you	c
see	c
almost	c
all	c
the	c
city	c
but	c
also	c
you	c
will	c
discover	c
another	c
perspective	c
of	c
this	c
magnific	i
building	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
charge	c
for	i
organise	i
the	c
conference	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
.	c
Do	c
not	c
worry	c
if	c
Richard	c
did	c
not	c
left	i
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
help	c
you	c

We	c
looked	c
in	i
every	c
hotel	c
in	c
Town	i
trying	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
best	c
offerd	i
.	c

We	c
found	c
two	c
good	c
hotels	c
but	i
we	c
decided	c
for	i
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
the	c
best	c
price	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
find	c
.	c

The	i
conference	c
day	c
our	c
school	c
driver	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
pick	c
you	c
up	c
in	i
the	c
hotel	c
and	c
take	c
you	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c

The	c
party	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
local	c
discotheque	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
so	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

as	c
the	c
leader	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
-	c
organisation	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
glad	c
if	c
I	c

you	c

My	c
wish	i

So	c
you	c

called	c

and	c
it	c
is	c
placed	i
in	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
this	c
hotel	c
is	c
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
subway	c
-	c
station	c
near	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Our	c
college	c
is	c
not	c
much	i
far	c
away	c
.	c

You	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
subway	c
-	c
train	c
.	c

After	c
three	c
stations	c
you	c
have	c
arrived	c
Brooklyn	i
street	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
come	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
subway	c
you	c
see	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c

n't	c
worry	c

There	c

any	c
rules	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
city	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
adventure	c
swimming	c
park	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
Water	c
World	c
on	c
your	c
last	c
day	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fund	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
any	c
further	c
information	c
please	c
call	c

My	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
telephone	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
communicate	c
although	c
they	c
are	c
at	i
two	c
different	c
places	c
.	c

People	c
use	c
the	c
telephone	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
people	c
need	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	c
telephone	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
job	i
-	i
life	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
companies	c
which	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Also	c
it	c
is	c
god	i
for	c
people	c
's	c
safety	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
call	c
the	c
police	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
danger	c
or	c
the	c
ambulance	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
injured	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
use	i
the	i
telephone	i
also	i
for	i
their	c
personal	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
or	c
to	c
your	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
far	c
away	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
and	c
receive	c
informations	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

This	c
invention	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
and	c
quickier	i
.	c

The	c
telephone	c
has	c
made	i
my	i
own	i
life	i
also	i
easy	c
and	c
quick	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
something	c
possible	c
you	c
can	c
not	c
do	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
telephone	c
is	c
very	c
efficient	c
for	c
people	c
.	c

the	c
No	c

hotel	c
is	c
quiet	c
and	c
near	c
the	c
conference	c
building	c

However	c

I	c
would	c
suggest	c
going	c
by	c
bus	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
form	c
of	c
transport	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
usually	i

we	c
would	i
organise	c
a	c
party	c
at	c
the	c

of	c
the	c

therefore	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
your	c

wear	i
a	c
suit	c
(	c
for	c
man	i
)	c
or	c
a	c
skirt	c
(	c
for	c
woman	i
)	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
this	c
party	c
would	i
be	c
in	c
your	c

the	i
following	i
years	c

there	c
are	c
a	c

quite	c
well	c
organized	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
starts	i
at	c
eight	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
will	c
finish	c
around	c
five	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
wear	c
something	c
informal	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
things	c
as	c
more	NA
comfortable	c
as	c
possible	c
to	i
our	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
my	i
area	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
an	c
afternoon	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
show	c
you	c
some	c
interesting	c
places	c
.	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
glad	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Affecting	c
Our	c
Lifes	i

Cars	c
,	c
boats	c
,	c
motobikes	i
,	c
airplanes	c
:	c
Who	c
did	i
never	i
use	i
this	i
once	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
.	c

The	i
humans	i
seems	i
always	i
that	NA
they	NA
are	i
running	c
and	c
the	c
fastest	c
of	c
this	i
inventions	c
is	c
certainly	c
,	NA
the	c
airplane	c
.	c

At	c
First	c
,	c
when	c
Santos	c
Dummont	c
invented	c
the	c
airplane	c
,	c
he	c
probably	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
how	c
the	NA
people	c
could	c
transform	c
his	c
creation	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
where	c
the	c
nations	c
fight	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
better	i
one	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
diferent	i
:	c
the	c
airplane	c
became	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
war	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
used	c
to	c
kill	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
airplane	c
has	c
brought	c
us	c
some	c
facilities	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
a	c
person	c
come	i
from	c
Brazil	c
to	c
Australia	c
?	i

Maybe	c
by	c
boat	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
could	c
take	c
too	c
long	c
!	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
is	c
definetely	i
,	NA
by	c
air	c
.	c

After	i
this	c
invention	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
so	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
and	c
congratulate	c
all	c
the	c
creators	i
who	c
invented	c
facility	c
things	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
airplane	c
is	c
definitely	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
have	i
changed	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
in	c
wars	c
.	c

Until	i
now	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
being	NA
important	c
in	c
the	c
transport	c
of	c
thousands	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
people	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
congratulate	c
Santos	c

An	c

The	c

to	c
be	c
very	c
new	c
but	c

People	c

this	c
place	c
and	c
called	c
it	c
\"	c

I	c
receved	i

and	c
I	c
'm	c

We	c

and	c
quiet	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
fine	c
here	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
near	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
are	c
going	c

At	c

In	c
the	c

The	i

very	c

but	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
fine	c
if	c

wear	c

Here	c
we	c

TELEVISION	c

What	c
would	c
our	c
world	c
be	c
without	c
television	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
easy	c
giving	i
an	c
answer	c
at	i
this	c
question	c
.	c

Television	c
is	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
,	i
it	i
permitted	i
us	c
to	i
better	c
our	NA
way	i
of	c
communication	c
.	c

This	c
animated	c
box	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
informations	i
coming	NA
from	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Television	c
has	c
affected	c
the	c
\"	c
all	c
days	c
life	c
,	c
,	c
,	c
too	c
.	c
We	c
can	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
enjoying	c
ourselves	c
with	c
some	c
programs	i
,	c
all	c
what	i
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
watching	i
.	c

And	c
we	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
easier	c
nothing	i
doing	i
than	c
engaging	c
ourselves	c
in	c
something	c
that	c
make	i
us	c
do	c
something	c

So	c
television	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
positive	c
or	c
a	c
negative	c
invention	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c

Now	c
we	c

to	c
answer	c
at	NA
the	c
introducing	c
question	c
.	c

No	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Television	c
has	c
become	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
thinking	i
that	c
it	c

information	NA
on	NA
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
introduce	c
one	c
building	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

\"	c
Sky	c
Heaven	c
\"	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
is	c
for	NA
fifteen	c
minutes	c
from	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

This	c
building	c
have	i
a	c
hundred	c
floor	i
and	c
it	c
takes	c
for	NA
five	c
minutes	c
from	i
the	c
grand	i
to	c
the	c
top	c
in	c
the	c
elevator	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
facilities	i
which	i
are	i
a	c
museum	c
,	c
a	i
exhibition	c
and	c
many	c
gift	c
shops	c
where	c
we	c
might	c
also	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
my	c
recommendation	c
is	c
that	c
Sky	c
Heaven	c
is	c
the	c
highest	i
building	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
get	i
the	i
top	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
and	c
experience	i
such	NA
a	i
amazing	c
view	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
museum	c
,	c
which	c
tell	i
you	c
about	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
my	c
town	c
so	c
easily	c
and	c
clearly	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
your	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
my	c
recommendation	c
and	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
by	c
tube	c
,	i
the	i
building	i
of	c
the	c

is	c
then	c
five	c
minutes	c
by	c

At	c

For	c
the	c
party	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	NA
wear	c
classic	c
clothes	c
;	c
maybe	c
something	c
black	c
and	c
not	c
red	c
or	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
wear	c
black	i
classic	i
trousers	c
and	c
a	c
white	c
jorsey	i
-	c
it	c
can	i
be	c
that	c
this	c
information	c
give	i
you	c
some	c
idea	c
too	c
..	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
about	c
three	c
hours	c
free	c
times	i
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
if	i
we	i
will	i
go	i
to	c
visit	NA
the	c
Arts	c
Museum	c

Of	i
if	NA
we	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
building	c
of	c
Biasco	c
is	c
the	c
,	c
,	c
Casa	c

Into	i
this	c

where	c
the	c

Best	c
regards	c
,	c

To	i
my	c
personal	c
opinion	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
useful	c
thing	i
which	c
has	c
been	c
invented	c
in	i
a	i
car	c
.	c

Cars	c
take	i
a	c
big	c
part	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Everywhere	c
you	c
look	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
cars	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
learn	i
how	c
to	c
drive	c
and	c
choose	i
to	c
travel	c
by	c
car	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
saves	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
comper	i
to	c
travelling	c
by	c
public	c
transport	c
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
also	c
more	c
reliable	c
than	c
other	c
types	c
of	c
transport	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
on	i
a	c
bus	c
stop	c
on	i
a	NA
cold	c
and	c
windy	c
weather	c
for	c
a	c
late	c
bus	c
,	c
or	c
being	i
stuck	c
on	c
a	c
train	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
railtrack	i
repairs	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
just	c
jump	c
into	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
tune	c
your	c
radio	c
onto	i
your	c
favourite	c
station	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
plesant	i
drive	c
to	c
your	c
distanation	i
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
even	c
more	c
important	c
for	c
emergency	c
situations	c
such	c
as	c
fire	i
in	c
a	c
house	c
or	c
if	c
somebody	c
is	c
critically	c
ill	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
if	c
our	c
police	c
,	c
doctors	c
or	c
fire	c
-	c
fighters	c
had	c
to	c
get	c
somewhere	c
quickly	c
on	c
foot	c
?	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
comment	c
on	c
this	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
I	c
realised	c
how	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
drive	c
a	c
car	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
living	c
in	c
Johanesburg	c
in	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
there	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
when	c
my	c
daughter	c
was	c
only	c
4	c
months	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
drive	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Johanesburg	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
dangerous	c
place	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
just	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
dangerous	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
public	c
transport	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
complex	c
where	c
we	c
lived	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
relay	i
on	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
to	c
a	c
shop	c
or	c
the	c
doctors	c
or	c
anywhere	c
else	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
soon	c
realised	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
drive	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
a	i
quality	c
life	i
for	c
my	c
daughter	c
and	c
myself	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
passed	c
my	c
driving	c
test	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
understand	c
how	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
car	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
every	c
day	c
everywhere	c
I	c
go	c
and	c
I	c
absolutelly	i
love	c
it	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
an	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
hotel	c
which	c
the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
is	c
The	c
Princes	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
near	c
York	c
Railway	c
Station	c
which	i
you	c
can	c
get	c
there	c
easily	c
.	c

By	c
rail	c
:	c
get	c
off	c
at	c
York	c
station	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
station	c
turn	i
left	c
and	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
on	c
your	c
left	c
hand	c
side	c
.	c

By	c
bus	c
:	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
buses	c
in	c
York	c
City	c
Centre	c
pass	c
the	c
station	c
,	c
or	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
event	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
we	i
agree	c
to	c
wear	c
formal	c
dresses	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
men	c
should	c
wear	c
suits	c
,	c
ties	c
and	c
the	NA
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
have	c
a	c
country	c
dancing	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
special	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
dancers	c
are	c
from	c
our	c
group	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
we	c
have	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
If	i
we	c
could	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
York	c
and	c
visit	c
the	c
historic	c
buildings	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
of	c
any	c
other	c
ideas	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
.	c
I	c
would	i
be	c
grateful	i
if	c
my	c
idea	c
and	c
all	c
the	i
information	c
could	i
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Inventions	c
have	c
affected	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
!	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
are	c
invented	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
are	NA
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
those	i
days	c
.	c

A	c
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
invention	i
which	c
is	i
very	c
useful	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
car	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
convenient	c
for	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
many	i
places	c
in	c
the	c
U.K.	c
Especially	c
,	NA
I	i
live	c
in	c
Whitwell	c
-	c
on	c
-	c
the	c
-	c
Hill	c
(	c
a	c
village	c
near	c
Malton	c
in	c
North	c
Yorkshire	c
)	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
if	i
I	i
had	i
n't	i
got	i
a	i
car	i
how	i
could	i
I	i
go	i
shopping	i
,	i
go	i
to	i
college	i
and	i
so	i
on	i
?	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
buses	c
(	c
number	c
843	c
and	c
845	c
)	c
which	c
go	c
pass	i
my	c
village	c
but	c
the	c
bus	c
fares	c
is	i
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
it	c
takes	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
has	c
largely	i
affected	c
my	c
own	NA
life	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
anywhere	c
by	c
car	c
a	c
lot	c
quicker	c
than	c
use	i
public	c
transports	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
and	c
sometimes	c
can	c
listen	c
to	c
Thai	c
music	c
which	i
I	c
brought	c
some	c
cassets	i
with	c
me	c
from	c
Thailand	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
a	c
car	NA
driving	c
theory	c
test	c
last	c
October	c
and	c
I	c
passed	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
pratice	i
driving	c
test	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
drive	c
the	c
car	c
myself	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
it	i
will	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
advantages	c
of	c
using	c
the	i
car	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
car	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	i
more	c
money	c
I	c
will	i
buy	c
another	c
car	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
has	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
say	c
many	c
thanks	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
invented	c
a	i
car	c
!	c

center	i
.	c

From	c

you	c
will	c
walk	c
until	i
the	c

because	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c

School	c

Introduction	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	i
you	i
about	i
the	i
location	i
,	i
the	i
architecture	i
and	c
the	i
story	c
of	c
the	c
old	c
Roman	c
school	c
from	i
Courtelary	c
.	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
get	i
there	c
with	c
your	c
group	c
because	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beautiful	c
thing	i
to	c
see	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
unique	i
old	c
Roman	c
school	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Location	c
:	c
Courtelary	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
and	c
the	c
school	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
hill	c
.	c

This	c
place	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
there	c
that	c
an	c
Emperor	i
had	i
growing	i
up	c
.	c

Architecture	c

at	i
school	c
.	c

They	c
decided	c
to	c
build	c
more	c
school	i
specially	i
in	c
Switzerland	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
were	i
considerated	i
clever	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
Second	c
World	c
War	c
all	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answering	i
our	i
question	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
already	i
have	i
booked	c
Palace	i
Hotel	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

There	i
is	c
the	c
hotel	c
near	c
my	c
college	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
five	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
my	i
college	c
by	i
walking	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
copy	c
the	c
map	c
around	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
start	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
in	c
the	c
dinning	i
room	c
.	c

People	i
who	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
party	c
are	i
many	c
professers	i
,	c
semi	c
-	c
professers	i
and	c
faculties	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
should	c
wear	c
formal	c
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
ideas	c
for	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
city	c
in	c
which	c
there	c
is	c
my	c
college	c
is	c
traditional	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
shrines	c
,	c
temples	c
,	c
and	c
castles	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
these	c
places	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
colleges	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	i
many	c
Japanese	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
at	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
gain	i
more	c
information	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
ask	c
me	c
everytime	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
one	c
building	c
.	c

My	c
town	c
is	c
the	c
capital	c
of	c
Japan	c
.	c

So	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
higher	i
buildings	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
like	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	i
have	i
only	c
one	c
building	c
which	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
'	c
Sunshine	c
60	c
'	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
highest	i
building	c
in	c
Tokyo	c
.	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	i
visit	i
.	i

I	c
have	c
three	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
recommendation	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
acquerium	i
in	c
the	c
building	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
this	i
is	c
the	c
60th	c
floor	c
,	i
I	c
went	c
there	c
first	i
time	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	i
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
visit	i
there	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
everywhere	i
in	c
Tokyo	c
.	c

The	c
scene	i
of	c
Tokyo	c
is	c
not	c
beautiful	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
think	i
that	c
this	c
city	c
is	c
a	c
developing	c
place	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
you	c
may	c
think	i
what	c
a	c
small	c
city	c
it	c
is	c
!	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
shops	c
inside	c
the	c
building	c
.	c
You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
for	NA
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
when	c
you	c
visit	c
,	NA
you	c
will	c
be	c
favorite	i
place	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
visit	i
there	c
.	c

This	c

's	c
name	c
is	c
'	c
Anitkabir	c
'	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
biggest	c
building	c
in	c
Ankara	c
.	c

It	c
built	i
in	c
1953	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
placed	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c

There	c
is	i
different	c

of	c

3	c
.	c
This	c
building	c
's	c
security	c
guards	c
are	c
very	c

soldiers	c

Their	c
aim	c
is	c
to	c
protect	c
the	c

there	c
is	c

Recommendations	c

I	c
recommend	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
building	c
in	c

it	c
includes	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
internation	i
student	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
hotel	c
which	c
we	c
have	c
reserved	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
far	c
from	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
taking	c
20	c
minutes	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
because	c
the	c
total	c
members	i
of	i
your	c
group	c
are	i
4	c
and	c
taxi	i
fare	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
expensive	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
taxi	c
rank	c
opposite	c
the	c
hotel	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
on	c
Thursday	c
,	c
it	c
starts	c
at	c
7	c
p.m.	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
of	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
wear	c
either	c
casual	c
dresses	i
or	c
fancy	c
ones	i
because	c
we	c
have	i
a	c
fancy	c
-	c
dress	c
competition	c
and	c
the	c
raffle	i
is	c
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
French	c
champaign	i
.	c

On	c
Friday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
set	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
centre	c
which	c
is	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

Many	c
beautiful	c
and	c
traditional	c
souvenirs	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
suggestion	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
flower	c
market	c
where	i
is	c
very	c
famous	c
for	c
tourists	c
because	c
it	c
covers	c
2	c
acres	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c
flowers	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
biggest	c
flower	c
market	c
in	c
this	c
area	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	c
you	c
soon	c
and	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
safe	c
journey	c

Invented	c
Light	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
sources	c
of	c
light	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
such	c
as	c
sunlight	c
,	c
moonlight	c
,	i
candle	i
light	i
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
natural	c
whereas	c
the	c
others	c
are	c
not	c
.	c

Owing	c
to	c
increasing	i
demand	c
of	i
light	c
for	c
more	c
activities	c
,	c
the	c
natural	c
source	c
is	c
not	c
adequate	c
.	c

There	i
,	c
electric	c
light	c
has	i
invented	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
electric	c
light	c
has	c
been	i
becoming	i
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
especially	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
.	c

Whatever	c
we	c
do	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
the	NA
electric	c
light	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
imaged	i
how	c
this	c
world	c
would	c
be	c
if	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
electric	c
light	c
?	c

It	c
must	c
have	c
been	i
a	c
big	c
impact	c
on	c
industry	c
,	c
agriculture	c
and	c
our	c
lifestyle	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
when	c
the	c
electricity	c
in	c
your	c
house	c
got	c
a	NA
short	c
circuit	i
.	c

Do	i
you	c
feel	c
uncomfortable	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
do	c
anything	c
much	c
without	c
light	c
?	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
electric	c
light	c
is	c
the	c
manuscript	c
of	c
other	c
electric	c
equipments	i
and	c
they	c
has	i
become	c
an	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
grateful	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
the	c
electric	c
light	c
for	c
comforting	c
our	c
lifestyle	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
once	c
when	c
we	c
keep	i
in	c
tuch	i
through	c
e	c
-	c
mail	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	i
the	c
language	c
,	i
we	i
used	c
English	c
but	c
we	i
both	i
were	i
not	i
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
by	i
the	c
time	c
which	c
made	c
us	c
misunderstand	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
problem	c
solved	i
by	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
now	c
still	c
friend	i

Thanks	c

Concerning	c

of	c
the	c
Conference	i
,	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
formal	c
there	i
fore	i
you	c
will	c
need	c
formal	c
clouding	i
as	c
you	c
know	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
Company	i
directors	c
,	c
Managers	i
etc	c
.	i

As	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
take	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
locall	i
museum	c
and	c
the	c
ruin	i
's	i
Castle	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
fist	i
you	c
will	c
find	c
a	c
very	c
intresting	i
collection	c
of	c
Roman	c
Vestiges	i
,	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
another	c

wich	i
it	i
supoused	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
Roman	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

I	c
always	c
had	c
consider	i
myself	c
been	i
very	c
looky	i
to	c
be	c
born	c
in	c
the	c
Century	i
because	c
all	i
the	c
amaizing	i
human	c
inventions	c
.	c

As	c
an	c
example	c
let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
of	NA
this	c
nation	c
how	i
it	c
has	c
developed	c
.	c

We	c
just	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
world	c
wold	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
inventions	c
created	c
thanks	c
to	c
the	c
industrial	c
revolution	c
to	c
these	i
day	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
there	c
should	c
emerge	c
more	c
grups	i
to	c
control	c
this	c
development	c
because	c
the	i
industrial	c
polution	i
that	c
it	NA
has	c
been	c
created	c
and	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
its	i
very	c
little	c
what	c
has	i
been	i
done	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
in	c
relation	c
to	c
our	c
embiroment	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
important	c
issue	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
letters	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
ready	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
which	i
hotel	c
is	c
better	i
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
an	c
idea	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
cheap	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
comfortable	c
bedrooms	c
and	c
place	i
for	c
parties	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
book	c
this	c
hotel	c
it	i
's	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
near	c
to	c
conference	i
it	i
's	c
only	c
15	c
minutes	c
by	i
walk	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
about	i
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
if	c
you	c
will	NA
invite	c
somebody	c
to	c
sing	c
and	c
give	c
to	NA
the	c
student	i
the	c
time	c
to	c
enjoy	c
theirselves	i
and	c
to	c
dance	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
it	NA
will	c
be	c
nice	c
.	c

The	i
clothes	i
now	i
that	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
it	NA
has	i
to	c
be	c
smart	c
,	c
not	c
how	i
you	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
casino	i
for	c
example	c
but	c
nice	c
casual	c
,	c
not	c
with	c
sports	c
shoes	c
or	c
T	c
-	c
shirts	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
that	i
you	c
have	c
three	c
ours	i
free	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
for	c
coffee	c
or	c
to	NA
visit	c
some	c
places	c
.	c

Those	c
are	c
my	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
like	c
it	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Today	c
our	c
article	c
it	NA
will	c
be	c
about	c
an	NA
inventions	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
inour	i
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	i
this	i
things	i
we	i
need	i
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
it	i
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
need	c
the	c
telephone	c
in	c
our	c
house	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
make	c
call	i
if	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
of	i
if	c
it	NA
something	c
happend	i
to	c
your	c
house	c
and	c
nobody	c
is	c
next	i
to	i
you	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
lamp	c
,	c
the	c
electricity	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
the	NA
people	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
electicity	i
and	c
if	c
they	c
wanted	c
for	c
example	c
to	c
read	c
or	c
to	c
cook	c
something	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
do	i
in	i
the	i
fire	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
have	c
electricity	c
because	c
without	c
this	i
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
television	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
have	c
TV	i
because	c
you	c
can	c
liten	i
what	i
it	NA
happend	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
watch	i
some	c
places	c
that	c
you	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
.	i

You	c
can	c
enjoy	c
you	NA
time	NA
to	i
watch	i
a	c
film	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
.	c

The	i
boat	c
it	i
's	i
not	c
so	c
important	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
it	i
for	c
fishing	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
some	c
places	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
now	i
is	i
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
you	i
can	c
go	c
wherever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

In	i
this	i
year	c
the	c
familys	i
they	c
have	c
3	c
cars	c
in	c
one	c
family	c
one	c
by	c
one	c
person	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
telephone	c
because	c
without	c
this	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
hotel	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
a	c
swimming	c
-	NA
pool	c
and	c
a	c
nice	c
bar	c
.	c

The	c
hotel	c
is	c
ten	c
minutes	c
far	i
from	c
the	c
conference	c
and	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
bus	c
available	c
to	c
go	c
directly	c
over	c
there	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	NA
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
dinner	c
in	c
a	c
luxurious	c
restaurant	c
so	c
people	c
must	c
have	c
nice	c
clothes	c
;	c
jean	i
's	i
is	i
not	c
allowed	c
.	c

Next	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
disco	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
dancing	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
in	c
my	c
area	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
old	c
town	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shops	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
old	c
castle	c
or	c
the	c
painting	c
museum	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
television	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
good	c
for	c
old	c
people	c
because	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
can	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
anymore	i
.	c

In	i
one	c
hand	c
it	i
's	c
because	c
they	c
have	i
not	i
enough	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
it	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
move	c
very	c
well	c
for	c
example	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
disabled	c
.	c

With	c
television	c
,	c
old	c
people	c
are	c
less	c
alone	c
because	c
most	c
of	NA
old	c
woman	i
have	i
not	i
her	i
husband	i
anymore	i
.	c

Television	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
with	i
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
being	c
informed	c
by	c
television	c
than	c
by	c
newspapers	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
relaxing	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
television	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
invention	c
for	c
children	c
when	i
they	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
and	i
while	i
they	c
are	c
watching	c
television	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
something	c
important	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

asked	c
for	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
conferents	i
and	c
other	c
points	c
in	c

The	c

of	i
the	c
college	c
which	i
the	c
conference	c
is	c
into	i
,	i
five	c
minutes	c

The	c
mobile	c

has	c
completely	c
changed	c

an	c
instrument	c
which	c
I	c

Apart	c
from	c

Do	c
you	c

with	c
your	c

which	c
would	c
n't	c

What	c
would	c
you	c
have	c
done	c
in	i
that	c
moment	c
without	c
a	c

?	c

You	c
were	c
at	c
home	c
in	c
less	c

Five	c

have	c
even	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
plus	c
for	c

For	c

,	c
now	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
more	c
places	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
mobile	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c

sending	c

is	c
an	c

All	c

Your	c

the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
far	c
from	c

However	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
congestions	i
and	c
delay	i
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
by	i
underground	i
,	c
Victoria	i
Street	c

.	c

You	c
would	i
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
other	c

approximately	c
15	c
minutes	c

of	c

could	i
be	c

jean	c
wears	c
and	c
T	c
-	c
shirts	c
would	i
be	c
common	c
on	c
that	c
day	c

Instead	c
staying	i
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
three	c

,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c

In	c

to	c
prepare	c
this	c

I	c
visited	c

some	c

asked	c

because	c
it	c

a	c

from	NA

It	c

I	c

CHANGE	i
OUR	c
LIFES	i

It	c
's	c
imposible	i
Nowdays	i
to	c
think	i
a	c
life	c
without	c
that	c
invention	c
how	c
quickly	c
affects	c
our	c
life	c
especially	c
in	c
business	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
a	c
big	c
company	c
without	c
a	c
phone	c
,	c
that	i
can	c
makes	i
business	c
more	c
quickly	i
than	c
anything	c
else	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
asking	c
too	NA
many	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
live	c
without	c
telephone	i
?	c

The	c
answer	c
was	c
all	i
the	c
same	c
\"	c
Imposible	i
\"	c
.	c

An	c
old	c
woman	c
told	c
me	c
how	c
important	c
was	i
the	i
phone	i
when	c
her	c
only	c
son	c
was	c
abroad	c
studing	i
computers	c
in	i
the	NA
\"	c
Chicago	c
University	c
\"	c
,	i
she	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
every	c
night	c
was	i
expecting	i
a	c
call	c
from	c
her	c
son	c
,	c
for	i
her	c
was	c
the	c
line	c
of	c
the	c
hapiness	i
.	c

However	c
it	i
was	c
one	c
persone	i
wich	i
he	NA
told	c
me	c
,	NA
it	i
was	c
n't	c
happy	c
at	c
all	c
with	c
the	c
phone	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
writte	i
a	c
lot	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
Christmas	c
to	i
wish	c
all	c
his	c
friends	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
Christmas	c
but	c
now	c
everybody	c
phone	i
him	c
losing	i
a	c
very	c
old	c
fashion	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	c
little	c
\"	c
box	c
\"	c
that	c
everybody	c
has	c
at	c
home	c
can	c
safe	i
your	c

especially	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
ring	c
a	c
doctor	c
in	c
an	c
emergency	c
situation	c

In	c
conclusion	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
a	NA
very	c
long	c
phone	c

and	c
you	c

n't	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
shame	c
that	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
see	c
Richard	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
illness	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
willing	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

Then	i
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
about	c
your	c
accomodation	i
,	c
our	i
college	c
which	c
I	c
belong	c
to	c
offers	c
visitor	i
free	c
accomodations	i
with	c
full	c
of	c
facilities	c
.	NA

(	c
for	c
example	c
bath	c
,	c
car	c
park	c
,	c
free	c
internet	c
access	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c
)	c

They	c
also	c
are	c
located	c
in	i
our	c
campus	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
by	c
walk	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
after	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	i
taken	i
place	c
at	c
our	c
student	c
council	c
hall	c
with	c
some	c
meals	c
.	c

This	c
party	c
is	c
unlikely	c
to	c
be	c
that	c
formal	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
not	i
to	i
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
trainners	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
for	NA
couple	NA
of	NA
ours	NA
,	c
you	c
'd	i
better	i
visit	c
Kamakura	c
City	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
30	c
minutes	c
from	c
our	c
campus	c
by	c
train	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
very	i
traditional	c
Japanese	c
city	c
where	c
so	NA
many	i
temple	i
and	i
heritages	i
are	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
it	c
and	c
maybe	c
get	i
familier	i
with	c
our	c
culture	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
other	c
questions	c
,	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

Oh	c
Baby	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
you	c
!	c

These	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
've	i
been	i
sorrounded	i
with	c
so	c
any	i
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
products	c
which	c
our	c
ancestors	c
invented	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
we	c
seldom	c
notice	c
how	c
much	NA
convinient	i
life	i
we	c
've	c
got	c
,	i
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
how	c
much	NA
inconvinient	i
our	c
grandparents	c
had	i
got	i
.	c

How	c
nasty	c
we	c
are	c
!	c

Let	c
us	c
try	c
to	c
appreciate	c
thier	i
importance	c
again	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
invention	c
which	c
is	c
most	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
is	c
a	i
personal	c
computer	c
.	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
full	c
time	c
student	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
their	c
classes	c
all	c
requires	i
us	c
to	c
have	c
personal	c
computer	i
and	c
use	c
them	c
at	c
any	i
times	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
take	c
the	c
class	c
on	c
computer	c
programming	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
definetly	i
need	c
one	c
and	c
it	i
holds	c
true	c
for	c
the	c
class	c
on	c
politics	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
statistic	i
on	c
your	c
computer	c
for	NA
doing	i
social	c
research	c
and	c
some	c
analysys	i
.	c

My	c
professor	c
said	c
'	c
go	i
and	c
get	c
familier	i
with	c
your	c
computer	c
,	c
otherwise	c
you	c
'll	c
fail	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
amazingly	c
easy	c
to	c
forget	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
inventions	c
which	c
we	c
useually	i
use	c
without	c
any	NA
questione	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
nature	c
of	c
human	c
being	i
.	c

But	c
,	NA
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
only	c
our	c
fault	c
but	c
the	NA
evidence	c
of	c
how	c
much	c
they	c
integrate	i
in	i
our	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
received	c
yesterday	c
.	c

Below	c
is	c
a	i
piece	i
of	i
information	c
you	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
at	c
Bournemouth	c
College	c
and	c
some	c
recommendations	c
,	c
which	c
might	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
hotel	c
booked	c
for	c
the	c
group	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
impressive	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
comfort	c
and	c
facilities	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
central	c
hotel	c
located	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
hall	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
either	c
by	c
bus	c
(	c
no	c
150	c
)	c
or	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

Next	c
you	c
are	c
welcome	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
party	c
organized	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
elevenish	c
p.m.	c
and	c
may	c
last	c
the	c
whole	c
night	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
disguised	i
there	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
wear	c
extravagant	c
multi	c
-	c
coloured	c
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
jump	c
at	c
opportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
historical	i
Pergam	c
's	c
Museum	c
before	c
leaving	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
amazing	c
masterpieces	c
are	c
exposed	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
in	NA
advance	NA
a	c
wonderful	c
trip	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	c
you	c
in	c
Bournemouth	c

From	c

Subject	c
:	c
Bournemouth	c
National	c
Museum	c

As	c
requested	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
Bournemouth	c
National	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
buildings	c
of	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

Below	c
is	c
a	c
summary	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
relevant	NA
points	c
and	c
some	c
recommendations	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

1	c
.	c
Architecture	c

The	c
architecture	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
in	c
itself	c
is	c
really	c
breathtaking	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
luxury	c
and	c
ornamentation	c
choice	NA
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
architectural	c
style	c
may	c
seem	c
a	c
bit	c
'	NA
heavy	c
,	c
this	c
building	c
is	c
really	c
a	c
masterpiece	c
with	c
no	c
similar	i
comparison	c
all	i
over	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

2	c
.	c
Exposition	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
whole	c
museum	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
rewarding	c
and	c
enriching	c
time	i
that	c
people	c
get	i
never	i
tired	c
of	c
looking	c
at	c
the	c
paintings	c
and	c
sculptures	c
of	i
each	c
section	c
of	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

3	c
.	c
Restaurant	c

The	c
adjoining	c
restaurant	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

The	c
waiters	c
are	c
friendly	c
and	c
always	c
ready	c
to	c
give	c
advice	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
what	c
visitors	c
need	c
after	c
their	c
trip	c
through	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
museum	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
the	c
other	c
museums	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
not	c
only	c
wonderful	c
masterpieces	c
but	c
also	c
a	NA
very	c
uncommon	i
architecture	c
and	c
a	c
quiet	c
restaurant	c
to	i
have	c
a	c
rest	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Smith	c
,	c

In	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
hotel	c
in	c
which	c
the	c
group	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
is	c
'	i
Palace	c
Hotel	c
'	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
travel	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
by	c
a	c
local	c
bus	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
bus	c
stop	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	c
no.31	i
or	c
3	c
will	c
take	c
you	c
directly	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
small	c
disco	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c
provided	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
you	c
could	i
wear	c
something	c
quite	c
casual	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	NA
visit	c
the	c
Edinburgh	c
Castle	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Scottish	c
Museum	c
,	c
as	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
have	c
the	i
student	c
discount	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
should	i
help	c
you	c
with	c
enough	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Could	c
modern	c
people	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
light	c
bulb	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Only	i
people	c
who	c
could	c
live	c
without	c
it	i
,	NA
must	i
be	c
extremely	c
weird	c
or	c
somebody	NA
in	c
a	c
very	c
difficult	c
situation	c
!	c

We	c
are	c
nearly	c
always	c
surrounded	c
by	c
the	NA
'	c
man	c
-	c
made	c
'	c
light	c
.	c

With	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
read	c
,	c
study	c
,	c
walk	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
people	c
relied	c
on	c
the	c
sunlight	c
,	c
moonlight	c
and	c
the	c
light	c
from	c
fire	c
.	c

These	c
were	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
very	c
unreliable	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
was	c
bad	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
fuel	c
ran	c
out	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
to	c
read	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
dark	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
hardly	c
happens	i
!	c

Well	c
,	c
unless	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
anything	i
wrong	c
with	c
the	c
power	c
supply	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
about	c
5	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
a	c
museum	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
toilet	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
light	i
was	i
turned	i
off	c
!	c

I	c
screamed	c
and	c
cried	c
since	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
experienced	c
being	c
in	c
a	NA
complete	c
darkness	c
before	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
light	c
was	c
turned	c
on	c
again	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
how	c
important	c
even	c
a	c
single	c
light	c
bulb	c
would	i
be	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
I	c
can	i
never	c
,	c
ever	c
live	c
without	c
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c

information	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
in	c

It'is	i

and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c

About	i
the	c
party	c
,	c
we	c
will	c

at	c
the	c

of	c
the	c
conference	c
at	c
the	c
hotel	c

will	c
stay	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	i
in	NA
a	c
friendly	i
atmosphere	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
about	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
our	c
group	c
,	c
so	c
dress	i
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
and	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
could	c
possibly	c
do	c
while	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
for	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
centre	c
is	c
just	c
right	NA
opposite	c
of	NA
the	c
hotel	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
some	c
people	c
may	c
want	c
to	c
just	c
wait	c
at	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c
.	c

The	c
cafe	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
information	i
will	c
be	c
useful	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
questions	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
than	c
happy	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
at	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
?	c

Imagine	c
how	c
your	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
if	c
you	c
woke	c
up	c
one	c
morning	c
and	c
found	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
electricity	c
had	c
gone	c
.	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
manage	c
to	c
get	c
yourself	c
ready	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
happens	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
wide	c
world	c
or	c
even	c
how	c
you	NA
would	i
get	c
yourself	c
breakfast	c
without	c
toaster	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
cope	c
with	c
all	c
those	i
?	c

Thank	c
god	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
had	NA
created	c
the	i
electricity	c
and	c
had	c
appliedapplied	c
it	c
into	c
every	c
appliances	i
.	c

The	i
electricity	i
is	c
a	c
clever	c
invention	c
.	c

Everything	c
bases	i
on	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
electricity	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
from	c
a	c
little	c
bulb	i
light	i
to	c
the	c
most	c
complicated	c
computer	c
system	c
which	c
stored	i
priceless	c
information	c
!	c

Life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
easy	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
electricity	c
.	c

The	i
electricity	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
keeping	c
our	c
lives	c
go	i
.	c

No	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
do	c
,	c
apparantly	i
,	c
you	c
need	c
the	NA
electricity	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
think	c
this	i
way	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	NA
electricity	c
,	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
no	c
other	c
inventions	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
,	c
personally	c
,	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
the	NA
electricity	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
already	c
affected	c
and	c
play	i
a	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
and	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
everyday	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
other	c
facilities	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
telephone	i
,	c
air	c

conditioner	c
,	c
fridge	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
are	NA
all	c
need	c
the	NA
electricity	c
.	c
That'is	i
why	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
my	c
life	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Smith	c

my	i
name	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
local	c
student	c
and	c
i	i
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
requested	c
information	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
for	c
your	c

have	c
been	c
booked	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
near	c
the	c
city	c
-	NA

.	c

The	c
hotel	c
is	c
just	c
three	c
busstops	i
away	c
from	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
bus	c
from	c
the	c
central	c
busstation	i
that	c
is	c
right	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
your	c
hotel	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
starts	c
just	c
one	c
our	i
after	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c

It	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
our	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
live	c
music	c
and	c
a	c
midnight	c

So	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
appear	c
very	c

just	c
as	c
you	c
like	c
it	NA
(	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
order	i
-	c
you	c
may	c
wear	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
)	c
.	c

For	c
your	c
last	c
day	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
vistit	i
our	c
historical	i
and	c
famous	c
city	c
-	NA
centre	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
organize	c
a	c
tourist	c
guide	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
old	c
buildings	c
and	c
sights	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
more	c
questions	c
write	c
me	c
a	c
short	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
point	c
in	c
history	c
.	c

From	c
there	c
on	c
people	c
got	i
mobile	c
and	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
travel	c
wherever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

Of	i
course	i
within	i
the	c
physical	c
barriers	c
.	c

People	c
now	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
far	i
away	i
places	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
leassure	i
time	c
,	c
to	c
relax	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
something	c
different	c
than	c
their	c
home	c
-	NA
countryside	NA
.	c

In	c
my	c
life	c
the	c
car	c
has	c
an	c
enormous	c
influence	c
.	c
I	c
come	c
from	c
a	c
rural	c
area	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
city	c
is	c
15	c
km	c
away	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
acceptable	c
bus	c
-	NA
or	c
rail	c
connection	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
quiet	i
hard	c
to	i
me	c
not	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunities	c
for	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
like	c
my	c
friends	c
that	i
lived	c
in	c
or	c
near	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
had	c
no	c
possibility	i
to	c
meet	c
them	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
vehicle	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
needed	c
my	c
Mom	c
or	c
my	c
Dad	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
where	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
car	c
and	c
I	c
use	c
it	c
daily	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
at	c
any	c
place	c
and	c
any	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
my	c
car	c
I	c
achieved	c
a	NA
great	c
freedom	c
.	c

Alice	c
knew	c
that	c
is	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
special	c
day	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
a	c
dream	c
where	c
somebody	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
that	c
day	c
would	c
be	c
special	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
like	c
every	c
morning	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
day	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
different	c
:	c
she	c
had	c
her	c
maths	c
exam	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
never	c
passed	c
an	i
maths	c
exam	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
nervous	c
.	c

Half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
exam	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
cafeteria	c
to	c
take	i
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
.	c

She	c
sat	c
down	c
and	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
she	c
found	c
a	c
lottery	c
ticket	c
.	c

Nobody	c
was	c
around	c
her	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Drank	c
her	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
and	c
she	NA
went	c
to	c
the	c
classroom	c
where	c
the	c
exam	c
took	c
place	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
the	i
exam	i
really	i
well	i
,	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
exam	c
she	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

She	c
spend	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
listening	c
to	c
music	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
lottery	c
ticket	c
and	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
TV	c
show	c
at	c
8	c
o'clock	c

At	c
the	i
time	c
,	c
she	c
turned	c
on	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
while	c
the	c
lottery	c
's	NA
man	c
was	c
shouting	c
the	i
winning	c
numbers	c
,	c
she	c
checked	c
hers	c
and	c
what	c
was	i
the	i

Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	NA
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
interesting	i
about	i
our	c
conference	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
Palace	c
hotel	c
is	c
your	c
accommodation	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
booked	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	i
nice	c
hotel	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	i
staying	c
there	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
finding	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
using	c
a	c
taxi	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
for	c
student	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
prepared	i
a	c
mini	c
-	c
bus	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
bus	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
your	c
hotel	c
at	c
1	c
p.m.	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
take	c
you	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
at	c
6	c
p.m.	c
You	c
can	c
have	c
dinner	c
with	c
wine	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
famous	c
in	c
our	c
area	c
and	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
semi	c
-	c
classical	c
concert	c
which	c
we	c
have	c
prepared	i
for	c
3	c
months	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
wear	c
formal	i
suit	c
and	c
dress	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
allowed	c
to	c
enter	c
this	c
party	c
unless	c
you	c
wear	c
casual	c
clothes	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
you	c
do	i
not	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
spending	c
your	c
extra	c
time	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
attraction	i
.	c

Cambridge	c
bus	c
tour	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
time	NA
for	c
you	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
of	c
knowing	i
Cambridge	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
City	i
centre	c
by	i
walking	i
tour	c
and	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
going	c
punting	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
pleasant	c
attraction	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
happy	c
with	c
our	c
conference	c
and	c
party	c
and	NA
etc	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
information	c
on	c
the	c
conference	c
as	c
you	c
required	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
your	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
convenient	c
to	c
stay	c
and	i
has	c
beautiful	i
landscape	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
recommend	c
you	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
by	c
subway	c
,	c
because	c
subway	i
station	c
is	c
situated	c
in	NA
5	c
minutes	c
'	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c

It	c
will	c
take	c

a	c

instruments	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
join	c
if	i

Therefore	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
this	c
area	c
has	c
its	c
reputation	c
for	c
shopping	c
centres	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
,	c
local	c
food	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

You	c

to	c
buy	c
them	c
in	i
reasonable	i
price	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
your	c
stay	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c

to	c
give	c
information	c
on	c
the	c
Amusement	c
Centre	c
in	c
Seoul	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
my	c
experience	c
and	c
on	c
views	c
expressed	c
by	c
local	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
interviewed	c
.	c

Facilities	c

It	c
was	c
found	c
that	c
the	c
Amusement	c
Centre	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
building	c
in	c
Seoul	c
to	c
enjoy	c
yourself	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
facilities	c
including	c
theatres	c
,	c
game	c
centres	c
,	c
Korean	c
restaurants	c
.	c

In	c
particular	c
,	c
the	NA
people	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
satisfied	c
with	c
theatres	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
screen	c
is	c
massive	c
.	c

The	c

Especailly	i
,	c
Korean	c
souvenir	c
shops	c
were	c
felt	c
to	c
be	c
extremely	c

However	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
buy	c
luxurious	c
things	c
as	c
well	c
if	c
you	c

.	c

Conclusion	c

In	c

in	i

I	c
will	c
give	i
you	i
now	i
some	c
useful	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
come	c
to	c
some	c
important	c
points	c
for	i
the	c
organisation	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
has	c
been	c

into	c
a	c
comfortabel	i
and	c
well	c
situatet	i

In	c

in	c
the	c
city	c

Furthermore	i
there	c
will	c

a	c
very	c
famous	c

band	c

You	c

not	c
have	c

You	c

some	c

Naturally	c
we	c

Inventions	c
have	c
affected	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
!	c

What	c
is	c
it	c
what	i
we	c
use	c
every	c
day	c
many	i
hours	c
?	c

Sometime	i
's	i
early	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
until	c
late	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Yes	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
well	c
know	i
in	c
almost	c
all	c
family	i
,	c
often	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
cannels	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
can	c
tell	i
us	c
news	c
in	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
what	i
happened	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
the	NA
invention	NA
for	NA
the	c
TV	c
is	c
,	NA
that	c
they	i
telling	i
about	NA
interesting	c
reports	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
about	c
animals	c
or	c
different	i
culture	c
from	i
other	c
countrys	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
they	i
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
programme	i
,	c
usually	c
something	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
be	i
also	i
relaxing	c
to	c
sit	c
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
after	c
a	c
busy	c
day	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
getting	c
important	c
information	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
watching	i
the	c
weather	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
were	i
present	i
in	c
wonderful	c
colour	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
useful	c
invention	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	i
send	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
violence	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
for	c
the	NA
children	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
imagine	c
to	i
live	i
without	c
televison	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
what	i
we	c
need	c
for	c
our	c
education	c
,	c
for	i
getting	c
news	c
and	c
other	c
helpful	c
information	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Surely	i
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
as	c
good	i
as	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
far	c
from	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

For	i
getting	i
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
you	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
bus	c
no.7	c
and	c
get	c
off	c
at	c
St.	c
James	c
College	c
,	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
say	c
that	c
a	c
band	c
will	c
be	c
playing	c
the	c
whole	c
night	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
special	c
guest	c
I	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
will	c
be	c
expected	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
wear	i
casual	c
clothes	c
,	c
I	c

's	c
no	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
last	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
propose	c
you	c
to	NA
attend	c
the	c
local	c
zoo	c

because	c
many	c
baby	c
animals	c
were	i
born	c
in	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
given	i
information	i
is	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c

I	c
'm	c

The	c
telephone	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
there	NA
's	NA
no	c
telephone	c
ringing	c
in	c
an	i
office	c
?	c

Or	c
to	i
live	i
your	c
live	i
without	c
chatting	c
for	c
hours	c
with	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
?	c

I	c

The	c
telephone	c
was	c
invented	c
by	c
Alexander	c
Graham	c
Bell	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
19th	c
century	c
.	c

It	i
was	i
an	i
invention	i
nobody	i
thought	i
how	i
important	i
and	i
how	i
widespread	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
almost	c
every	c
household	c
in	c
the	c
western	c
world	c
owns	c
a	c
telephone	c
,	c
and	c
calling	c
to	NA
relatives	c
or	c
friends	c
spread	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
no	c
strange	c
thing	c
.	c

People	c
need	c
the	c
telephone	c
not	c
only	c
for	c
chatting	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
exchanging	c
information	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
short	i
and	c
direct	c
way	c
with	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	i
answer	c
immediately	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
no	c
telephone	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
phone	c
box	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
our	c
village	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
flat	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
first	c
piece	c
of	c
furniture	c
I	c
've	NA
bought	c
was	c
the	c
telephone	c
.	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
take	i
it	i
away	i
from	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	NA
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
already	c
talked	c
to	c
Richard	c
Brown	c
and	c
he	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Next	c
week	c
I	c
will	c
be	NA
start	c
organising	c
some	c
events	c
for	c
this	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
event	i
will	c
organize	i
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
hotel	c
that	c
will	i
you	i
stay	i
.	i

Palace	i
Hotel	c
is	c
opposite	c
the	NA
park	i
'	i
Clifton	i
'	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
near	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
that	c
hotel	c
because	c
is	i
it	i
near	c
the	c
college	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	NA
use	NA
a	NA
transport	c
.	c

Because	c
you	c
know	c
where	c
is	i
the	i
college	i
and	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	NA
me	NA
some	c
things	c
at	i
the	c
college	c
to	c
hotel	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
better	c
to	i
come	i
all	i
the	i
group	i
in	i
college	i
and	c
then	c
we	c
can	c
go	i
all	i
together	c
to	c
the	c
'	NA
Palace	c
Hotel	c
'	NA
.	c

The	c
conference	c
start	i
at	c
9:00	c
o'clock	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
college	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
I	c
'm	c
thinking	c
about	c
some	c
dance	c
and	c
singing	c
events	c
.	c

Tell	i
me	i
your	i
idea	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
we	i
need	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
must	i
be	c
uniform	i
,	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
conference	c
to	i
London	c
and	c
every	c
year	c
are	i
coming	i
lectures	i
from	c
other	c
colleges	c
.	c

Finally	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
we	c
have	c
organised	c
a	c
seeing	i
-	i
crossing	i
around	c
London	c
.	c
You	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
visiting	i
some	c
museums	c
and	c
zoo	i
parks	NA
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
nice	c
idea	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
more	c
information	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
my	c
telephone	c
number	c
is	c
047***.	c
Please	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
more	i
ideas	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Nowdays	i
all	i
the	i
people	i

Telephone	i
is	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
investigation	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Telephone	i
is	c
type	i
of	c
communication	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
with	i
your	c
friends	c
,	c
parents	c
,	c
partner	i
or	i
to	c
ask	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
them	c
without	c
wondering	c
how	c
can	i
be	NA
communicate	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Especial	i
if	c
some	c
of	c
your	c
relatives	c
or	c
friends	c
are	i
living	i
in	c
other	i
country	c
you	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
them	c
and	NA
everyday	i
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
far	c
a	i
way	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Today	c
with	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
technology	c
has	i
been	i
improved	i
and	i
the	i
abilities	i
of	i
the	i
telephone	i
.	c

They	i
are	c
telephones	c
that	c
you	i
have	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
people	i
at	i
the	c
line	c
.	c

Also	c
you	c
can	c
leave	c
a	c
message	c
if	c
you	c
call	c
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	i
someone	c
.	c

The	c
last	i
type	c
of	c
telephone	c
,	NA
is	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
use	c
it	c
everywhere	c
and	c
at	NA
anytime	c

Finally	c
telephone	i
except|apart	c
from	c
type	i
of	c
communication	c
,	c
is	c
type	i
and	i
socialisation	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
who	i
are	c
so	i
bussy	i
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
to	c
see	c
our	c
friends	c
,	c
we	i
can	c
call	c
them	c
and	c

or	c

Especial	i
the	i
young	i

using	i
many	c
hours	c
the	i
telephone	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
trouble	c
for	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

Telephone	i
is	c
very	i
important	c
investigation	i
if	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
it	c
correct	i
without	c
use	i
it	c
as	c
type	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
about	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
a	c
hotel	c
whose	NA
name	NA
is	i
Palace	i
Hotel	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
taxi	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
buses	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
formal	c
,	c
therefore	c
you	c
have	i
to	c
wear	c
formal	c
clothes	c
like	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
a	c
dress	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	c
wear	c
a	NA
jean	i
or	c
something	c
.	i

On	c
your	c
last	c
day	c
you	c
have	c
an	i
afternoon	c
free	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
area	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
fantastic	c
park	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
park	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
or	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
zoo	c
or	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
amazing	c
lake	c
in	c
the	c
park	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
,	NA
which	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c

If	c

Power	i
Of	c
Computurs	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
can	c
a	c
computer	c
affect	c
your	c
life	c
?	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
effects	i
more	i
than	c
you	c
think	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
lyrics	c
of	c
the	c
songs	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nearly	c
impossible	c
to	c
have	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
lack	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
first	c
bought	c
a	c
computer	c
as	i
I	c
was	c
in	c
university	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	i
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
computer	c
programmer	c
.	c

That	i
time	c
I	c
met	i
the	c
magic	c
world	c
of	c
computers	c
.	c

Linking	c
to	c
the	c
internet	i
was	c
so	c
popular	c
.	c

Internet	i
was	c
something	c
amazing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
think	i
you	c
have	c
every	c
information	i
you	c
need	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
?	i

Can	c
you	c
think	i
you	c
contact	i
with	NA
anyone	c
who	c
is	c
from	c
any	c
country	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
?	i

I	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
on	c
internet	i
and	c
it	c
really	c
interest	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
their	c
culture	c
by	c
speaking	c
them	i
on	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
this	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
this	i
,	c
today	c
companies	c
can	c
do	c
nothing	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
works	i
with	c
computers	c
from	c
now	c
on	c
.	c

Computers	c
changed	i
my	c
life	i
style	i
,	c
my	c
opinion	i
about	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
effect	i
everyone	c
's	c
life	c
directly	c
or	c
indirectly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
M.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
hotel	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
82	c
Regent	c
Street	c
,	c
so	c
that	NA
it	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
bus	i
number	i
3	i
;	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
the	c
bus	c
stop	c
is	c
just	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
off	c
immediately	c
after	c
the	c
church	c
that	c
you	c
pass	c
,	c
on	c
your	c
right	c
hand	NA
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
party	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
at	c
8.00	c
o'clock	c
and	c
a	c
buffet	c
will	c
be	c
served	c
at	c
8.30	c
p.m.	c
It	c
would	i
be	i
also	i
possible	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
and	c
drink	c
cocktails	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
recommend	c
your	c
students	c
to	NA
bring	c
their	c
Identity	c
Card	i
to	c
prove	c
their	c
age	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
wear	i
very	c
smart	c
dress	i
and	c
for	c
men	c
it	i
is	i
oblidged	i
the	i
tie	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
I	c
would	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	i
the	c
City	c
Centre	c
to	i
spend	i
your	c
last	c
hours	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
re	i
interested	c
in	c
Archeology	i
you	c
should	c
vitis	i
the	c
History	c
Museum	c
in	c
Garden	c
Square	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
my	c
letter	c
of	c
interest	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
to	i
live	i
without	c
your	c
car	c
?	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
manage	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
without	c
it	c
?	c

I	i
the	c
last	c
fourty	i
years	c
people	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
completely	c
addicted	c
by	i
using	c
their	c
own	NA
car	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	NA
citizens	c
has	i
got	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
cities	c
are	c
getting	i
more	c
polluted	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
facility	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easy	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
everywhere	c
sitting	c
either	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
and	c
carring	i
lugguage	i
and	c
shopping	c
bags	c
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
cover	c
not	c
only	c
short	c
distance	c
but	c
also	c
can	c
be	c
used	c
for	c
long	c
journey	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
it	c
would	c
had	c
been	c
extremely	c
exhausting	c
travelling	i
riding	i
a	c
hourse	i
but	c
nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
big	c
and	c
spacious	c
cars	c
and	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
optionals	i
to	c
choose	c
with	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
made	c
people	c
be	NA
lazy	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
stressed	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
traffic	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
advantages	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
save	c
time	c
and	c
money	c

some	c

Who	c
could	c
have	c
invented	c
such	c
a	c
useful	c
item	c
?	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
nobody	c
has	c
got	c
this	i
clue	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
most	c
clever	c
person	c
on	c
earth	c
!	c

the	i
world	c
is	c
packed	c
with	c

many	c
tipes	i
of	c

from	c
the	c
common	c

most	c
sophisticate	i
and	c
comfortables	i
others	c
finding	c
a	c
baste	i
range	c
of	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
the	c
chair	c
is	c
without	c
a	c
doubt	c
the	c
most	c
usefull	i
gadget	c
ever	c
invented	c

Some	c

wishing	i

one	i
by	c
the	c

for	c
some	c

Although	c
is	i

that	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
phoned	c
to	NA
the	c
tourist	c
information	c
last	i
week	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
accomodation	i
of	i
the	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
book	c
at	NA
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	c
outstanding	c
building	c
situated	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
.	c

The	c
Hotel	i
is	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
position	c
,	c
10	c
minutes	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
reach	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c
students	c
will	c
enjoy	c
walking	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c
starts	c
at	c
5	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
and	c
finishes	c
at	c
7	c
pm	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
should	c
wear	c
smart	c
dress	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
lots	c
of	c
interesting	c
people	c
and	c
important	i
meeting	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
town	c
and	c
appreciate	i
its	c
monuments	c
and	c
art	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
day	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
pic	i
-	i

in	c
the	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c

and	c
Idea	i
will	c

hour	c
by	c
underground	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
from	c
the	c
conference	c
would	c
be	c
by	c
taking	c
the	c
Picadelly	c
line	c
.	c

However	c
you	c
would	i
take	c
bus	c
number	c
150	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
city	c
centre	c
and	c
you	c
have	i
some	i
free	i
time	i
also	i
.	c

Regarding	c
to	NA
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
wear	i
some	i
dress	c
for	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
an	c
elegant	c
suit	c
for	c
a	c
man	c
,	c
though	c
,	NA
it	c
is	c
no	i
formal	i
do	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
finish	c
quite	c
late	c
so	c
we	c
've	c
decided	c
to	c
provide	c
a	c
bus	c
which	c
would	i
take	c
you	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
safely	c
.	c

Basicaly	i
,	c
during	c
three	c
hour	i
time	NA
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
nobody	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
all	c
of	c
interesting	i
places	c
of	i
London	c
.	c

However	c
you	c
would	i
have	i
a	c
long	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
river	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
essential	c
photos	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
welcoming	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Are	c
you	c
always	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
telephon	i
ring	i
?	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	i
concerned	NA
the	c
telephone	c
was	c
invented	c
in	c
19th	i
century	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
affecting	i
our	c
lifes	i
very	c
quickly	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
different	c
ways	i
of	c
communication	c
as	i
TV	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
internet	i
was	c
introduced	c
,	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
would	i
n't	i
have	i
imagined	i
the	NA
lifes	i
without	c
this	i
.	c

We	c
were	i
able	i
even	i
to	c
have	c
our	c
own	c
telephone	c
kept	c
in	c
our	c
pocket	c
for	c
a	NA
some	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
always	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
personal	c
phone	c
rings	c
.	c

On	NA
the	NA
other	NA
hand	NA
I	c
wonder	c
whether	c
you	c
have	c
experienced	c
some	c
situations	c
when	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
your	c
mobile	c
switched	c
on	c
.	c

This	c
invention	c
has	c
affected	i
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
traveling	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
imagined	c
beeing	i
in	c
tough	i
with	c
my	c
family	c
or	c
friends	c
without	c
internet	i
or	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
having	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
keeping	c
contact	i
with	c
friends	c
at	c
the	NA
time	i
we	i
are	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
have	i
been	i
knowledge	i
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
without	c
interrupting	i
others	c
.	c

The	c
Telephone	i
:	c
A	i
great	c
invention	c
.	c

Imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
hard	c
to	c
imagine	c
our	c
lives	c
without	c
this	c
invention	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
living	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
invented	c
.	c

Must	i
had	i
been	c
such	c
a	i
exciting	c
thing	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
someone	c
living	c
thousands	c
of	c
miles	c
for	i
........	c
and	c
now	c
for	c
us	c
is	i
just	c
as	c
simple	c
as	c
dial	i
a	c
number	c
and	c
talk	i
to	c
whoever	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
is	i
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
phone	c
conversation	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
family	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
telephone	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
business	c
and	c
emergencies	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
bank	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
weekly	c
meetings	c
with	c
our	c
Director	c
living	c
800	c
kilometers	i
far	i
,	c
and	c
he	c
does	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
come	c
here	c
,	c
we	c
just	c
have	c
a	c
phone	c
conference	c
where	c
everybody	c
can	c
talks	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
it	c
!	c

What	c
about	c
emergencies	c
?	c

A	c
phone	c
call	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
an	c
ambulance	c
can	c
save	c
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
having	c
a	c
heart	c
attack	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
realize	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
some	c
inventions	c
we	c
use	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
think	c
....	c
,	NA
what	c
would	c
we	c
do	c
without	c
them	c
!	c

INVENTIONS	c
HAVE	c
AFFECTED	c
ALL	c
OUR	c
LIVES	c
!	c

The	i
invention	i
without	i
no	i
doubt	i
,	NA
that	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
by	i
far	i
is	c
the	c
car	c
.	c

Cars	c
have	c
definitely	c
changed	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
refering	i
only	c
in	c
a	c
positive	c
way	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
a	c
negative	c
way	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Picture	c
this	c
:	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
such	c
as	c
London	c
or	c
New	c
York	c
with	c
no	c
cars	c
on	c
their	c
streets	c
.	c

Could	i
you	c
imagine	c
it	c
?	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
.	c

Cars	c
are	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
lives	c
.	c

Traffic	c
jams	c
make	c
people	c
nervous	i
,	c
sometimes	i
really	c
upset	c
and	c
violent	c
.	c

But	c
,	NA
anyway	i
,	i
people	i
use	i
cars	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
them	c
we	c
suffer	c
from	i
them	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
I	c
use	c
public	c
transport	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
imagine	c
my	c
weekends	c
without	c
my	c
beloved	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
need	c
it	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
the	c
pollution	c
,	c
mainly	c
caused	c
by	c
cars	c
and	c
any	NA
other	c
four	c
-	c
wheel	c
motored	i
vehicle	i
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
that	c
contradictorious	i
?	c

To	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
countryside	c
and	c
being	i
able	c
to	c
breath	i
fresh	c
,	c
non	i
-	i
polluted	i
air	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
as	i
far	i
as	i
I	i
am	i
concerned	i
does	c
not	c
help	c
to	c
maintain	c
a	c
clean	c
air	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
in	i
selling	c
my	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
over	c
the	c
last	c
10	c
years	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
given	c
me	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
freedom	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
gone	c
with	c
me	c
to	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
fantastic	c
places	c
,	c
and	c
change	i
my	c
life	c
for	c
a	c
new	c
life	c
:	c
whithout	i

Hampton	c
Court	c
Palace	c

Introduction	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
for	c
information	c
on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
last	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
place	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

Location	c
:	c

Hampton	c
Court	c
palace	i
is	c
localizated	i
in	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
.	c

In	NA
addition	NA
to	NA
that	NA
,	NA
I	c
think	c
this	c
town	c
is	c
wonderful	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
magical	c
beauty	c
.	c

transport	i
:	c

to	i
get	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
palace	i
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
train	c
from	c
Waterloo	c
train	c
station	c
.	c

From	c
there	c
depart	i
the	i
trains	i
to	i
Hampton	i
Court	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
by	i
train	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
train	c
station	c
is	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
Hampton	c
Court	c
palace	i
.	c

Price	c
:	c

there	i
is	c
a	c
great	c
price	c
for	c
children	c
,	c
students	c
,	c
adults	c
and	c
families	c
.	c

They	i
are	c
between	c
three	c
and	c
six	c
pounds	c
each	c
.	c

Conclusion	c
:	c

Hampton	c
Court	c
Palace	c
is	c
a	c
building	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
history	c
and	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
an	c
excellent	c
chance	c
for	c
this	c
group	c
of	c
American	c
students	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

How	c
wonderful	c
\"	c
light	c
\"	c

We	c
need	c
light	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
not	c
just	c
night	i
time	i
.	c

We	c
need	c
lamp	i
light	i
in	c
offices	c
or	i
schools	c
or	i
some	i
places	c
during	c
the	c
day	i
time	i
.	c

How	c
is	i
the	i
wonderful	i
life	i
after	i
invention	i
the	i
light	i
.	c

Here	c
we	c
just	i
talk	i
about	c
the	c
light	c
we	c
invented	c
apart	c
from	c
nature	i
light	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
small	c
,	c
we	c
lived	c
in	c
country	c
yard	c
,	c
I	c
remembered	i
,	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
have	c
oil	c
lamps	c
which	c
used	c
a	c
cotton	c
string	c
dipping	c
in	c
the	c
oil	c
in	c
the	c
small	c
bottle	c
and	c
made	c
it	c
burned	c
the	c
tip	c
of	c
the	c
cotton	c
string	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
light	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
time	NA
,	i
it	i
was	i
very	c
little	c
light	c
on	NA
,	c
and	c
many	i
things	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
under	i
the	c
oil	i
lamps	c
because	c
the	c
light	c
range	c
was	c
very	c
small	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	i
any	c
light	c
outside	c
our	c
house	c
,	c
no	i
light	c
on	c
the	c
road	c
or	c
field	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
always	c
very	c
scared	c
whenever	c
or	c
wherever	c
.	c
because	c
most	c
places	c
.	c

Covered	c
by	c
dark	c
,	c
dark	c
and	c
dark	c
.	c

This	c
scaring	i
dark	c
is	c
still	c
affecting	c
my	c
life	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
stayed	i
out	c
after	c
dark	c
today	c
except	c
accompanying	c
by	c
my	c
family	c

it	c
to	c

anything	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
do	c

We	c
believe	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
light	c
today	c
,	c
specially	i
in	c
city	i
life	NA

we	i
have	c
a	c

after	c

to	c

Which	i
we	i
definately	i
need	c

I	c
dare	c
to	NA

In	c
my	c

the	c
most	c
interesting	c
is	c
the	c
Castle	i

It	c
is	c
placed	i
on	c
a	c
hill	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
very	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c

to	c
your	c

arrived	c
yesterday	c

I	c
do	c
welcome	c

giving	c
the	c
informations	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

Firstly	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
explain	c
the	c
way	i
from	c
the	c
PALACE	c
HOTEL	c
,	c
where	c
your	c
group	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
,	c
to	c

conference	c
.	c

The	c
hotel	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
Seoul	c
,	c
therefore	c
there	c
many	i
ways	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
underground	c
,	c
which	c
takes	c
about	c
20	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
map	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
to	c
you	c
on	c
the	c
day	c
of	c

will	c

the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
's	c
Percel	c

at	c

,	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
dinner	c
will	c
be	c
served	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
formal	c
,	c
so	c

wear	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
dress	c
,	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
it	c
is	c

for	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

to	c

Korean	c
palace	c
Kyong	c
Bok	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
's	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
visit	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
has	i
never	c
experienced	c
an	c
oriental	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
just	c

take	c
you	c

is	c
highly	c

.	c

It	c
highlights	c
the	c

history	c
and	c

the	c

,	c
and	c

History	c
.	c

The	c
kingdom	c
Chosun	c
has	c
a	c
history	c
for	i
500	c
years	c
and	c
lasted	c
until	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
20th	i
century	c
.	c

Kyong	c
Bok	c
Palace	c
was	c
the	c
main	c
residence	c
of	c
the	c
royal	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
its	c
size	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
kings	c
of	c
Chosun	c
loved	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	NA
nature	c
,	c
the	c
palace	c
had	c
a	c
huge	c
garden	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
destroyed	c
by	c
the	c
army	i
of	i
Japan	i
,	c
and	c
now	c
there	c
remains	c
only	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
original	c
palace	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
special	c
monument	c
for	i
the	c
last	c
queen	c
of	c
Chosun	c
who	c
was	c
killed	c
by	c
the	c
Japanese	c
army	c
.	c

.	c

Activity	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
that	c
this	c
palace	c
is	c
also	c
popular	c
for	c
the	c
youngsters	c
,	c
who	c
tends	i
to	c
dislike	c
the	NA
historical	c
visit	i
,	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
various	c
activity	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
try	c

traditional	c
games	c
of	c
Korea	c

there	c
is	c
a	c
chance	c

which	c
helds	i
daily	c
in	i
the	c
front	c
gate	c
of	c
the	c
palace	c
.	c

.	c

Final	c
Recommendation	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
out	c
of	c
question	i
not	c
to	c
visit	c
Kyong	c
Bok	c
Palace	c
unless	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
Korean	c
history	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
find	c
many	c
interesting	c
points	c
there	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
urge	c
you	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
experience	c
the	c
tradition	c
of	c
Korea	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
where	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
international	i
student	c
conference	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
ideas	c
and	c
suggestions	c
of	i
what	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
can	c
do	c
during	c
your	c
free	c
time	c
here	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
the	c
central	c
area	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
take	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
town	c
hall	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
progressed	i
.	c

The	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
from	c
your	c
hotel	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
buses	i
461	c
or	c
176	c
(	c
the	c
bus	c
stop	c
is	c
opposite	c
to	NA
the	c
hotel	c
)	c
or	c
we	c
can	c
hire	c
a	c
minibus	c
for	c
you	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
an	c
extra	c
charge	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
party	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Special	c
awards	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
to	c
the	c
students	c
whose	c
reports	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Less	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
likely	c
to	c
be	c
as	c
our	c
night	i
club	i
so	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
music	c
,	c
dancing	c
and	c
fun	c
are	c
provided	c
.	c

Please	c
note	c
that	c
the	NA
alchocholich	i
drinks	c
are	c
only	c
sold	c
untill	i
11	c
pm	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
wear	c
whatever	c
you	c
like	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
party	c
.	c

Coming	c
back	c
to	c
ideas	c
and	c
Suggestions	c
I'v	i
promised	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
about	NA
free	i
afternoon	c
befor	i
you	c
catch	c
your	c
plane	c
I	c
can	i
advise	c
you	c
to	c

our	c
zoo	c
or	c
to	c
for	i
a	c
picnik	i
in	c
a	c
park	c
befor	i
you	c
will	NA
go	c
to	c
the	c
night	NA
party	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Can	c
you	c
see	c
how	c
many	c
inventions	c
you	c
are	c
surrounded	c
with	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
?	c

Such	c
a	NA
simple	c
and	c
usuall	i
things	c
like	c
a	c
telefone	i
,	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
so	NA
only	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
normal	c
and	c
usuall	i
for	c
us	c
(	NA
or	NA
we	NA
have	NA
got	NA
used	NA
)	NA
as	c
we	c
use	c
them	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Hundred	i
years	c
before	i
people	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
use	c
an	c
electric	c
lump	i
not	i
saying	i
about	i
a	c
car	c
or	c
computer	c
.	c

They	i
have	i
intentions	i
improved	i
our	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
since	c
they	c
had	NA
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
every	i
one	i
beleives	i
it	c
is	c
really	c
so	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
many	c
of	NA
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
are	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
and	c
useful	c
as	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
see	i
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
say	i
about	c
enviroment	i
pollution	c
which	c
cars	c
and	c
other	c
vechicles	i
make	i
,	c
overspending	c
the	c
electricity	c
using	c
electric	c
equipment	c
and	c
some	c
others	i
.	i

But	c
to	i
my	c
opinion	c
if	c
peoples	i
inventions	c
take	i
a	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
they	c
are	c
right	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
telefone	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
many	c
people	c
's	c
lifes	i
as	c
it	c
makes	i
you	c
to	NA
be	NA
able	NA
to	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
anyone	c
does	i
n't	c
matter	c
wherever	i
you	c
are	c
(	c
I	c
am	c
talking	c
about	c
mobile	c
phones	c
which	c
now	i
have	i
a	i
majority	i
of	i
our	NA
choice	c
)	c
.	c

Computers	c
make	c
everything	c
much	c
faster	c
so	c
everything	c
is	c
now	c
based	c
on	c
computer	c
systems	c
.	c

An	i
electric	c
lamp	c
was	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
hundred	i
years	c
before	i
(	c
but	i
for	i
that	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
revolution	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
possible	c
to	i
survive	i
for	i
us	i
without	c
an	NA
eclectric	i
life	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
shipbuilding	c
development	i
people	c
could	i
make	i
all	c
the	i
geographical	c
discoveries	c
,	c
and	c
an	NA
automobile	c
transport	c
is	c
undenyable	i
neccecerity	i
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

In	i
case	i
of	c
all	i
said	i
I	c
am	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
advantages	NA
of	NA
peopel	i
's	c
inventions	c
are	c
much	c
higre	i
the	i
all	c
their	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
help	c
with	i
giving	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

According	i
to	c
your	c
first	c
question	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
conference	i
the	c
students	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
where	c
the	c
reservation	c
has	c
been	i
already	i
made	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
about	c
five	c
minutes	c
walk	c
from	c
the	c
nearest	c
tube	c
station	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
South	c
Wimbledon	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
were	c
informed	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
all	c
attendants	i
of	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
afterwards	c
at	i
the	c
hotel	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Minding	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
entirely	i
sociable	i
meeting	i
I	c
believe	c
that	c
casual	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
option	c
for	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
answering	i
your	c
last	c
question	c
about	c
student	i
's	i
day	c
-	NA
out	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
visiting	c
a	i
local	c
Lawn	c
tennis	i
Museums	i
and	c
Wimbledon	i
Tennis	c
Courts	c
as	c
it	i
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
international	c
tourists	i
attractions	c
.	c

If	c
you	c

GENERAL	c
INFORMATION	c

would	c

heart	c
of	c
Warsaw	c
and	c
surrounded	c
by	c
the	c
buildings	c

There	c
is	c
a	i
square	i
old	i
Market	i
with	c
the	c
magnificent	c
statue	c
of	c
the	NA
King	c
Zygmunt	c
,	NA
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

FACILITIES	c
:	c

.	c

Inside	c
the	c
Palace	c

.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
Portrait	c
Gallery	c
in	c
the	c
left	c
wing	c
of	c
the	c
Palace	c
.	c

.	c

The	c
Old	c
Town	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
place	c
for	c
afternoon	i
stroll	c
with	c
a	c
great	c
deal	c
of	c
restaurants	c
,	c
caffes	i

easy	i
reach	i

cashpoints	i
,	i
lavatories	i
,	i
emergency	i

.	c

POSITIVE	c
POINTS	c

.	c

It	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
by	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
public	c
transport	c

.	c

There	c
are	c
numbers	i
of	c
hotels	c
or	c
youth	c
hostels	c
to	c
stay	c
overninight	i
,	c
if	c
necessary	c

.	c

Most	i
of	i
the	i
admissions	i
are	i
absolutely	c
free	c
.	c

NEGATIVE	c
POINTS	c

.	c

A	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
Palace	c
might	c
be	c
closed	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
constant	i
renovations	c
.	c

.	c

All	c
the	c
facilities	c
are	c
usually	c
overcrowded	c
during	c
a	i
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

CONCLUSION	c
:	c

Despite	c
the	c
few	c
drawbacks	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
strongly	c
recommend	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
of	i
an	i
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
hotel	i
which	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
is	c
Palace	i
Hotel	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
have	c
two	c
choices	i
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
a	c
bus	c
or	c
a	c
train	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
as	c
convinience	i
as	c
getting	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
before	c
we	c
will	c
leave	c
there	NA
,	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
formal	c
party	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
well	c
-	NA
dressed	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
wear	c
a	NA
formal	c
dress	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
some	c
finger	c
foods	i
and	c
drinks	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
for	c
end	i
of	c
conference	i
.	c

End	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
a	i
center	i
of	c
the	c
town	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
many	c
places	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
and	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
a	c
nice	c
and	i
a	c
suitable	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
for	NA
three	c
hours	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

If	c
a	i
telephone	c
haven't	i
been	c
invented	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
lived	c
perfectly	c
like	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Would	i
n't	c
you	c
think	c
we	c
rely	c
on	c
it	c
more	c
than	c
we	c
expect	i
?	c

A	c
telephone	c
is	c
used	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
contact	c
with	NA
someone	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
an	i
emergency	c
situation	i
and	c
an	i
internet	i
.	c

It	c
has	c
various	c
way	i
to	c
use	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
used	c
by	i
these	c
purpose	i
,	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
keeps	c
our	i
company	c
.	c

Even	i
if	i
you	c
feel	c
alone	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
and	c
hear	c
from	c
your	c
friend	i
easily	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
makes	c
you	c
happy	c
.	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
people	c
lived	c
without	c
this	c
perfect	c
invention	c
.	c

But	c
how	c
?	c

They	c
used	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	i
someone	i
with	i
a	i
letter	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
taking	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
catch	c
up	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
only	c
way	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
they	c
have	c
invented	c
a	i
telephon	i
.	c

Now	c
we	c
could	i
feel	c
the	c
world	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c
beaus	c
of	c
a	c
telephone	c
.	c

Who	c
would	c
n't	c
thank	i
for	c
this	c
great	c
invention	c
?	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
received	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
pleased	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

M.	c
Brown	c
has	c
booked	c
rooms	c
in	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
first	c
class	c
hotel	c
.	c

The	c
easiest	c
way	c
from	i
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
with	i
the	NA
bus	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
bus	c
stop	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
your	c
hotel	c
.	c

Take	c
the	c
bus	c
in	c
direction	i
center	i
town	i
.	c

After	c
four	c
stops	c
get	c
off	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
this	c
bus	c
stop	c
is	c
'	c
Kongresshaus	c
'	c
.	c

If	i
you	c
leave	i
the	c
bus	c
,	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
house	i
opposite	i
the	c
road	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
miss	c
it	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
we	c
will	c
eat	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
restaurant	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
in	i
a	c
disco	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
disco	c
you	c
musn't	i
wear	c
blue	c
jeans	c
.	c

Finally	c
at	i
your	c
last	c
day	c
I	c
propose	i
you	c
to	NA
do	c
a	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
you	c
two	c
hours	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
any	i
time	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
souvenirs	c
from	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
more	c
questions	c
,	c
write	c
me	i
back	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

I	c
will	c
write	c
about	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
computer	c
our	c
work	c
is	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
time	c
with	i
computers	c
,	c
people	c
had	c
to	c
write	c
every	i
time	i
a	i
whole	i
letter	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
would	i
correct	c
a	c
word	c
,	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
whole	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
computer	c
we	c
can	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
correct	c
a	c
word	c
or	c
change	c
the	c
name	c
without	c
writting	i
the	c
whole	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c
We	c
save	c
the	c
letter	c
and	c
in	c
three	c
week	i
we	c
could	c
send	c
it	c
to	c
another	c
person	c
.	c

I	c
work	c
at	i
a	c
bank	c
and	c
I	c
work	c
all	c
day	c
with	c
computers	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
hand't	i
ay	i
one	NA
,	c
we	c
had	i
to	c
write	c
all	c
the	c
transactions	c
on	c

If	c
I	c
order	c
money	c
for	c
our	c

with	c
the	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
I	i
will	c
arrive	c
the	c
day	c
after	c

But	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
write	c
a	c

and	c
to	c
send	c
it	c
by	c
post	c

the	c
money	c

I	c

the	c

The	c

in	i

To	c
get	c
from	c
the	c

you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c

and	c
after	c
nearly	c

of	c

conference	c

will	c
take	c

at	c
the	c

Some	c
musicians	c
will	c
play	c
classical	c
music	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
different	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c

you	i
should	c
wear	c
some	NA
formal	c
clothes	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
necessary	i
really	c
pretty	c
clothes	c

For	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
museum	c
of	c
the	c
Red	c
Cross	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
these	i
informations	i
will	c
help	c
you	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

The	c
portable	i
phone	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
useful	c
invention	c
!	c

During	c
all	c
mankind	c
history	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
discovers	i
who	c
tried	c
to	c
make	c
human	c
life	c
better	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
century	c
that	c
there	i
were	i
the	i
most	i
biggest	i
discoveries	i
made	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
phone	c
without	c
cable	i
was	c
invented	c
,	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
research	c
went	c
on	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
portable	i
phone	c
is	c
getting	i
always	i
smaller	c
and	c
more	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
portable	i
phone	c
is	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
,	c
because	c
nearly	c
everybody	c
has	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
one	c
can	c
always	c
call	c
somebody	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
some	c
portable	i
phones	c
have	c
a	c
connection	c
to	c
the	c
web	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
read	c
newspapers	i
if	c
one	c
hasn't	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
the	c
portable	i
phone	c
has	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
somebody	c
is	c
phoning	c
at	i
home	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
rush	c
to	c
take	i
the	c
phone	c
,	c
being	c
afraid	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
recommend	c
this	c
extremely	c
important	c
invention	c
to	c
those	c
who	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
portable	i
phone	c
.	c

from	NA
England	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	NA
visit	c
the	c
cannals	i
and	c
small	c
villages	c
around	c
Basingstoke	c
.	c
You	c
could	c
find	i
the	c
opportunaty	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
country	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Time	c
flies	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
whoever	c
invented	c
the	NA
cars	c
and	c
transportation	c
vehicles	c
did	i
the	c
most	c
respectable	c
invention	i
of	c
the	c
word	i
.	c

I	c
say	c
that	c
it	i
must	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	i
for	c
us	c
because	c
they	c
save	c
our	c
times	i
passing	c
so	c
fast	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
deny	c
how	c
quickly	c
we	c
get	c
somewhere	c
by	c
car	c
or	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
10	c
times	c
as	c
quick	c
as	c
getting	c
somewhere	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
having	c
anyof	i
them	c
.	c

Would	c
n't	c
be	i
unbarable	i
and	c
painful	c
.	c

Ceartainly	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
just	c
like	c
mine	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
rural	c
area	c
far	c
from	c
any	c
village	c
,	c
town	c
,	c
or	c
city	c
center	i
.	c

The	i
nearest	c
civilization	c
takes	c
me	c
1	c
hour	c
on	c
foot	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
car	c
,	c
no	i
local	c
bus	c
service	c
to	c
use	c
.	c

Even	c
comeing	i
to	c
Basingstoke	c
seems	c
like	c
a	i
international	c
journey	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
ofcause	i
this	c
stops	c
me	c
everytime	c
to	c
live	c
sociable	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
aware	c
of	NA
that	c
the	NA
time	c
flies	c
for	c
me	c
.	c
I	c
must	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
befor	i
it	c
is	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
confess	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
usefull	i
invention	c
for	c
the	NA
humanity	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
delighted	c

decided	c
to	c
take	c
a	NA
part	c
in	c
our	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
I	c
answer	i
all	c
your	c
questions	c
with	c
plesuare	i
.	c

Firstly	c

the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
has	c

It	c

one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
comfortable	c
hotels	c
in	c
our	c
sity	i
and	c
situated	c
only	c
half	c
a	c
mile	c
from	c
main	i
building	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
simple	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
by	c
foot	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
our	c

-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	i
included	i
dinner	c
and	c
dancing	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
advise	c
you	c
to	c
wear	c
something	c
not	c
very	c
formal	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
an	c
afternoon	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
visiting	c
local	c
historical	i
places	c
(	c
castles	c
,	NA
builded	i
in	c
13-th	i
century	c
)	c
or	c

gallery	i
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
beatiful	i
Bodnant	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

to	c
the	c
meeting	c
with	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
people	c
's	c
inventions	c
around	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
so	c
used	c
to	c
them	c
,	NA
that	c
sometimes	c
think	i
they	c
existed	i
always	i
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
very	c
practical	c
,	c
other	i
are	c
rather	c
strange	c
.	c

I	c
thing	i
,	NA
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
importent	i
and	NA
affecting	i
our	i
life	i
inventions	i
is	c
the	c
telephone	c
.	c

Imagine	c
life	c
without	c

.	c

You	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
road	c
,	c

On	i
another	c
situation	c
,	c
your	c
son	c
is	c
ill	c
,	c
he	c
needs	c
help	c
urgently	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
,	NA
the	c
phone	c
has	c
saved	c
many	c
lifes	i
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
ring	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
mum	c
,	c
only	c
for	NA
chating	i
in	c
any	c
time	c

Thanks	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
man	i
,	NA
who	c
invented	c
it	c
,	i
unfornutely	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
forgotten	c

It	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

it	c
is	c
with	c
great	c
regret	c
that	c
I	c
hear	c
of	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
's	c
illness	c
,	c
and	c
hope	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
soon	c
in	c
an	NA
excellent	c
health	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
both	c
pleased	c
and	c
honoured	c
to	c
expect	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
group	c
in	c
the	c
context	c
of	c
our	c
international	c
meeting	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
made	c
arrangements	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
is	c
located	c
between	c
the	c
airport	c
and	c
our	c
location	c
,	c
a	c
bus	i
shuttle	i
has	c
been	c
organised	c
to	c
pick	i
all	c
our	c
guests	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
room	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
at	i
the	c
'	c
Royal	c
Room	c
'	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
an	c
outstanding	c
reputation	c
for	c
its	c
quality	c
and	c
seriousness	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
all	c
guests	i
will	c
be	c
asked	c
to	c
wear	c
the	c
corresponding	i
clothes	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
accepted	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
three	c
hours	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
check	i
-	i
in	i
your	i
lugages	i
at	c
the	c
airport	c
and	c
then	c
,	c
after	c
a	c
five	c
-	c
minutes	i
bus	c
ride	c
,	c
spend	c
your	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
marvellous	c
'	c
Old	c
City	c
'	c

Best	c

The	c
technological	c
revolution	c
taking	c
place	c
today	c
can	c
be	c
directly	c
linked	c
to	c
the	c
amazing	c
evolution	c
of	c
our	c
communication	i
abilities	i
throughout	i
those	i
last	c
years	i
.	c

The	c
inevitable	c
invention	c
symbolizing	c
this	c
aspect	c
in	c
our	c
ordinary	i
life	c
is	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
and	c
irrefutable	c
that	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
this	c
invention	c
has	c
becomed	i
a	c
necessary	c
condition	c
in	c
some	c
professional	c
activities	c
.	c

Trades	c
,	c
politicians	c
and	c
taxi	c
drivers	c
are	c
but	c
a	c
few	c
examples	c
of	c
such	c
needs	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
common	i
man	c
seems	c
to	c
ignore	c
how	c
important	c
and	c
useful	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
becomes	c
,	NA
when	c
in	c
the	c
hands	c
of	c
a	c
high	c
-	c
school	c
student	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	i
then	i
a	c
real	c
obsession	c
for	c
the	c
average	c
students	i
,	c
as	c
e	i
uses	c
it	c
before	c
the	c
lessons	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
,	c
during	c
lunch	c
and	c
,	c
especially	c
,	c
during	c
examinations	c
...	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
common	c
mistake	c
to	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
sole	c
purpose	c
of	c
such	c
an	NA
usage	c
is	c
to	c
communicate	c
information	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
,	c
since	c
its	c
major	c
role	c
is	c
actually	c
to	c
allow	c
the	c
student	c
and	c
the	c
parents	c
to	c
discuss	c
during	c
everyday	i
's	c
courses	c
.	c

Bottom	i
line	c
is	c
that	c
any	c
teacher	c
complaining	c
about	c
this	c
situation	c
should	c
confiscate	c
not	c
the	c
student	c
's	c
phone	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
parents	c
'	c
!	c

bus	i
54	i
that	c
stops	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

The	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	c
designed	c
to	c
give	c
rough	i
ideas	i
about	i
many	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
traditional	c
foods	c
,	c
music	c
,	c
dances	c
and	c
games	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
leader	c
of	c
each	c
group	c
has	c
to	c
wear	c
a	i
costume	i
of	c
her	c
country	c
.	c

Other	c
members	c
of	c
groups	i
can	c
wear	c
a	NA
normal	c
pretty	i
formal	c
dress	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
recommend	c
that	c
you	c
will	NA
visit	c
the	c
place	c
that	c
is	c
located	c
at	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
about	c
1000	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
it	c
fascinating	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
any	c
computers	c
at	c
all	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
do	c
this	c
unless	c
you	c
are	c
living	c
deep	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
dessert	i
!	c

If	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
how	c
many	c
computers	c
we	c
use	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
how	c
dependent	c
we	c
are	c
on	c
them	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
clear	c
that	i
invention	i
of	c
computers	c
has	c
certainly	c
had	c
a	c
significant	c
impact	c
on	c
all	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
all	c
infrastructures	c
such	c
as	c
transports	i
and	c
power	c
stations	c
are	c
ran	i
using	c
computers	c
government	i
uses	c
them	c
to	c
organise	c
all	c
sorts	c
of	c
things	c
in	c
a	c
country	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
kids	i
of	c
services	i
and	c
businesses	c
such	c
as	c
hospitals	c
and	c
supermarkets	c
use	c
them	c
as	c
essential	c
capitals	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
today	c
rely	c
on	c
computers	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
from	c
this	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
convincing	c
enough	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
say	c
that	c
a	c
personal	c
computer	c
is	c
also	c
an	c
amazing	c
tool	c
.	c

It	c
improves	c
productivity	i
of	c
my	c
homework	c
,	c
that	i
is	i
often	i
essay	c
writing	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
it	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
access	c
to	NA
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Since	c
I	c
live	c
abroad	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
is	c
really	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
contact	c
with	c
my	c
bestfriend	i
and	c
to	i
know	c
what	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
country	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
greatest	c
ever	c
invention	c
is	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
that	i
has	c
affected	c
both	c
indivisuals	i
and	c
a	NA
society	c
as	c
a	c
whole	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
enquiry	c
about	c
this	c
year	c
international	i
conference	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
The	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
on	c
Old	c
Street	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
signs	c
to	c
follow	c
from	c
Central	i
train	c
station	c
.	c

The	c
conference	c
is	i
commensing	i
on	c
31st	c
June	c
2001	c
from	c
10.00	c
-	c
15.00	c
.	c

Light	i
lunch	c
will	c
be	c
provided	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
relaxing	c
party	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
dressed	i
-	i
code	c
for	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
could	NA
wear	c
the	c
same	c
outfit	c
as	i
you	c
wear	i
for	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
included	c
the	i
local	c
map	c
,	i
there	i
are	c
some	c
ideas	c
at	i
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
map	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
book	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
-	c
walk	c
tours	c
,	c
We	c
have	c
arrange	i
spacial	i
discounts	c
for	c
the	c
conference	c
attendance	i
.	c

Personly	i
I	c
recommend	c
the	c
Dicken	i
's	i
tour	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
length	c
of	NA
walking	i
and	c
very	c
historical	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
covered	c
all	c
information	i
you	c
would	i
need	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

P.S.	c
Please	c
find	c
the	c
enclosed	i
map	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
interesting	c
buildings	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
Liverpool	c
Street	c
Station	c
is	c
at	c
the	c
top	c
list	i
.	c

The	c
building	c
itself	c
looks	c
grand	c
and	c
elegant	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
this	c
building	c
has	i
served	i
half	c
-	NA
a	c
million	c
commuters	c
in	c
a	c
day	c
,	c
it	c
always	i
clean	c
and	c
functional	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
parts	c
of	c
Liverpool	c
Street	c
Station	c
that	c
make	c
it	c
so	c
interesting	c
building	i
.	c

The	c
newly	c
decorated	c
section	c
is	c
fairly	c
modern	c
style	i
with	c
escalators	c
and	c
touched	i
-	c
screen	c
ticket	c
machine	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
well	c
linked	c
into	i
the	c
old	c
underground	c
station	c
which	c
it	NA
is	c
such	c
a	c
contrast	c
in	c
transformation	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
bit	c
is	c
rather	c
unique	c
and	c
charming	c
.	c

You	c
could	i
really	c
imagine	c
how	i
it	c
looked	c
like	c
in	c
the	c
old	c
day	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
another	c
surprising	c
section	c
in	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
far	c
back	i
of	c
the	c
station	c
is	i
also	NA
connected	c
to	c
a	c
spacious	c
well	c
designed	c
pedestrians	i
park	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
a	NA
great	c
architecture	c
that	c
was	c
designed	c
to	c
provide	c
services	c
to	i
the	c
public	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
heart	c
of	c
city	i
and	c
everyone	i
would	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
find	i
without	i
doubt	i

The	c

is	c
playing	NA
in	c
a	c
rent	i
and	c
in	c
the	c
greenground	i

There	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
barbecue	c

and	c
many	i
more	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
surprice	i
!	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
wear	c
leisure	c
-	NA
clothes	c
to	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
afternoon	c
you	c
could	c
go	c
on	c
a	c
city	c
-	NA
tour	c
,	c
visite	i
the	c
museum	i
of	c
Fine	c
Arts	c
or	c
enjoy	c
the	c
beautiful	c
flower	c
garden	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
common	i
park	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
could	i

some	c
ideas	c
.	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

What	c
would	c
life	c
be	c
without	c
the	c
phone	c
?	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
a	c
world	c
without	c
phone	i
?	c

How	i
was	i
it	i
in	c
the	c
18	i
century	c
with	c
no	c
opportunity	i
to	i
communicate	i
by	c
phone	c
and	c
how	i
would	i
it	i
be	i
now	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
imagine	c
how	c
our	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
.	c

We	c
are	i
living	i
in	c
a	c
busy	c
world	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
business	c
world	c
you	c
use	c
the	c
phone	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
your	c
clients	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
appointments	c
,	c
to	c
order	c
an	c
article	c
e.c	i
.	c
;	c
then	i
,	c
time	c
is	c
money	c
!	c

How	c
has	c
the	c
phone	c
affected	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
?	c
I	c
think	c
,	NA
that	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
.	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
call	c
my	c
friends	c
from	c
an	i
other	i
city	c
and	c
just	c
say	c
\"	c
hello	c
\"	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
difficult	c
and	c
take	i
more	c
time	c
to	c
make	c
an	c
appointment	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
did	i
the	i
phone	i
-	i
revolution	i
for	c
us	c
?	c

It	c
saves	c
time	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
group	c
of	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
coming	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
is	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
is	c
simply	c
to	c
walk	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
the	c
college	c
is	c
situated	c
500	c
meters	i
away	NA
from	c
the	c
Hotel	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
party	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
7	c
p.m	c
and	c
last	c
until	c
late	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
should	c
wear	c
to	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
is	c
to	c
relax	c
after	c
a	c
busy	c
day	c
,	i
therefore	i
you	c
and	c
your	c
students	c
can	c
put	c
jeans	c
and	c
sport	c
shoes	c
on	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
guided	c
tour	c
by	c
coach	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
afternoon	c
free	c
before	c
your	c
plane	c
takes	c
off	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
will	c
help	c
to	i
know	c
each	c
other	c
better	c
and	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
information	i
on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
so	c
many	c
places	c
of	c
interest	c
in	c
Lausanne	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
Olympic	c
Museum	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
notable	c
for	c
the	c
following	c
reasons	c
:	c

The	c
Olympic	c
Museum	c
dates	c
from	c
the	c
19th	c
century	c
and	c
is	c
the	c
biggest	c
in	c
Europe	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
sports	c
men	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
since	c
the	c
first	c
Olympic	c
Games	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
evolution	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
understand	c
why	c
changes	c
gradually	c
have	c
been	c
done	i
to	c
improve	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
admire	c
every	c
kind	c
of	c
equipments	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
any	c
particular	c
sport	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
the	c
story	i
of	c
sport	c
in	c
general	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
new	c
technologies	c
which	c
are	c
used	c
nowaday	i
n	i
high	c
competitions	c
.	c

The	c
museum	c
is	c
near	c
the	c
city	c
center	i
and	c
is	c
accessible	c
by	c
bus	c
or	c
walking	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
takes	i
you	c
an	c
afternoon	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
and	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
a	c
drink	c
or	c
a	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
on	c
the	c
third	c
floor	c
,	c
well	i
-	NA
known	c
for	c
being	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
establishment	i
in	c
Lausanne	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
recommendations	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
choice	c
of	c
a	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
we	c
have	c
received	c
from	c
you	c

in	c
order	c
to	c

First	c

I	c
'd	c

you	c
to	NA

it	i
will	c
only	c
take	c
you	c
about	c

The	c

a	c
blessing	c
.	c

Who	c
of	c
you	c
could	c
imagine	c
life	c
without	c
the	c
telephone	c
?	c

Not	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
call	c
your	c
friend	c
and	c
ask	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
pop	c
in	i
for	c
a	c
moment	c
?	c

Not	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
lie	c
to	c
your	c
mother	c
-	c
in	c
-	c
law	c
and	c
pretend	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
attend	c
her	c
garden	c
party	c
because	c
of	c
an	c
illness	c
,	c
without	c
having	c
to	c
look	c
her	c
in	c
the	c
eye	c
?	c

When	c
Alexander	c
Graham	c
Bell	c
first	c
invented	c
the	c
telephone	c
,	c
he	c
had	c
no	c
idea	c
of	NA
how	c
popular	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

Its	c
first	c
appliance	i
was	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
it	c
in	c
person	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
is	c
connected	c
by	c
a	c
telephone	c
system	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
could	i
imagine	c
life	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Take	c
me	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
it	c
whenever	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
advice	c
,	c
or	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
call	c
off	c
a	c
meeting	c
for	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
not	c
always	c
walk	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
and	c
say	c
\"	c
Sorry	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
cancel	c
our	c
meeting	c
\"	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
late	c
anyway	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Life	c
definitely	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
the	c
telephone	c
.	c

We	c
use	c
it	c
daily	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
information	c
or	c
to	c
pass	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

Just	c
try	c
to	c
spend	c
one	c
week	c
without	c
using	c
a	c
telephone	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

So	c
do	c
n't	c
take	c
the	c
telephone	c
for	c
granted	c
,	c
but	c
keep	c
in	c
mind	c
that	c
our	c
modern	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
is	c
mainly	c
due	c
to	c
its	c
invention	c
.	c

Dear	c

the	c

Ethnographic	c
Museum	c

The	c
car	c
:	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
human	c
inventions	c
that	c
has	c
the	NA
most	c
affected	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
of	c
people	c
from	c
industrial	c
countries	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
more	c
than	c
the	c
percents	c
of	c
the	NA
world	c
industry	c
is	c
related	c
to	c
the	c
automotive	c
business	c
:	c
car	c
manufacturing	c
,	c
gasoline	i
extracting	i
and	c
refining	c
,	c
tyres	i
recycling	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

The	c
industrial	c
countries	c
have	c
encountered	c
deep	i
evolution	i
of	i
their	c
strictures	i
since	c
the	c
car	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
available	c
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
last	c
Century	i
only	c
a	c
few	c
very	c
rich	c
people	c
could	c
afford	c
a	c
car	c
;	c
it	c
was	c
kind	i
of	c
leisure	c
or	c
sport	c
to	c
drive	c
one	c
.	c

Today	c
almost	c
everyone	c
owns	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
needs	c
it	c
for	c
daily	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
transport	c
network	c
has	c
changed	c
according	i
to	i
this	c
social	c
evolution	c
.	c

The	c
increasing	c
number	c
of	c
cars	c
related	c
and	c
infrastructure	c
are	i
now	c
creeting	i
problems	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
roads	c
and	c
motorways	c
are	c
overcrowded	c
,	c
and	c
enviromment	i
issues	i
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
related	c
to	c
the	c
intensive	c
use	c
of	c
cars	c
and	c
lorries	c
.	c

People	c
and	c
governments	c
are	c
concerned	c
about	c
how	c
to	c
limit	c
the	c
effects	c
of	c
cars	c
on	c
the	c
enviromment	i
without	c
impacting	i
their	c
mobility	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
tough	c
challenge	c
for	c
this	c
new	c
century	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
:	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Juniper	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
helping	c
to	c
organise	c
the	c
conference	c
in	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
Palace	i
Hotel	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
No.41	c
bus	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	i
it	i
only	c
takes	c
ten	c
minutes	c
approximately	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
morning	c
of	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
starting	c
at	c
9:00	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
staffs	i
will	c
join	i
together	c
in	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
and	c
talk	c
about	c
personal	i
experience	i
.	c

The	c
main	c
aim	c
of	c
it	i
is	c
to	c
deepen	i
the	c
friendship	c
among	c
all	c
these	c
pupils	c
coming	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fine	c
if	c
you	c
wear	i
casual	c
clothes	c
and	c
look	i
smart	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
made	c
arrangement	i
for	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
the	c
last	c

for	c
you	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
free	c
I	c
will	c
show	c
you	c
arround	i

.	c

You	c
can	c
visit	c
our	c
newly	c
-	NA
built	c
science	c
lab	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
would	c
acquire	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

to	c
meeting	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c

.	c

Best	c
choice	c

Welcome	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
for	i
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
I	c
'll	NA
recommend	c
British	i
Museum	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
is	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
almost	c
everything	c
about	c
British	c
history	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
museum	c
looks	c
very	c
old	c
as	i
some	c
other	c
buildings	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
modern	c
inside	c
.	c

After	c
going	c
through	c
the	c
enormous	c
main	c
door	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
huge	c
white	i
round	i
building	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
library	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
this	c
library	c
before	NA
!	c

The	c
British	c
Hall	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
first	c
floor	c
,	c
not	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
library	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
a	c
large	c
number	c
of	c
valuable	c
things	c
.	c

Almost	c
each	i
one	c
tells	c
you	c
a	c
story	c
or	c
gives	c
you	c
a	c
picture	c
about	i
British	c
history	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
will	c
gain	c
a	c
wonderful	c
lesson	c
!	c

Apart	c
from	c
the	NA
national	c
history	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
content	i
about	c
the	c
past	i
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
many	c
sections	c
such	c
as	c
Asia	i
Hall	c
,	c
Egypt	i
Hall	c
,	c
Europe	i
Hall	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Countless	i
fascinating	c
things	c
will	c
definely	i
take	c
you	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
to	c
appreciate	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
visit	c
to	c
British	i
Museum	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	i
certainly	i
able	c
to	c
put	c
your	c
history	c
textbook	c
away	c
!	c

Also	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
any	c
money	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
transport	c
is	c
extremely	c
convenient	c
,	c
therefore	c
British	i
Museum	c
is	c
your	c
best	c
choice	c
.	c
Do	c
n't	c
be	c
hesitant	c
any	c
more	c

mood	i
I	i
am	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
makes	c
me	c
feel	c
good	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
bake	c
without	c
an	c
oven	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
grateful	c
for	c
this	c
invention	c
which	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
my	c
passion	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
oven	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
someone	c
who	c
does	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
live	c
one	i
month	c
without	c
using	c
the	i
oven	c
.	c

Besides	i
that	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
should	c
look	c
carefully	c
into	c
what	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
buys	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
positive	c
that	c
after	c
such	c
an	c
experience	c
everyone	c
says	i
that	c
the	c
oven	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
important	c
invention	c
for	c
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

I	c
'm	i
thanking	i
the	c
person	c
who	c
invented	c
the	c
oven	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c

,	c
which	c
includes	c
dinner	c
and	c
an	c
announcement	c
by	c

The	c

You	c

Whatever	c
you	c
choose	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c

If	c

more	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
conference	c
and	i
something	i
else	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
ask	c
me	c
.	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Some	c
inventions	c
are	c
not	c
regarded	c
as	c
great	c
things	c
even	c
though	c
the	NA
life	c
without	c
them	c
can	c
not	c
be	c
imagined	c
.	c

People	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
impression	c
on	c
important	c
inventions	c
any	c
more	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
have	c
been	c
getting	c
more	c
popular	c
and	c
common	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
which	i
is	i
still	c
believed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
extreamly	i
important	c
invention	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
electricity	c
invented	c
by	c
Edison	c
.	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
electricity	c
is	c
such	c
an	c
important	c
invention	c
is	c
that	c
most	c
of	NA
machines	c
,	c
appliances	c
and	c
equipments	i
which	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
modern	c
times	c
can	c
be	i
operated	i
with	i
only	i
electricity	c
,	c
which	c
makes	c
people	c
not	c
to	i
too	c
much	c
phisical	i
labour	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
many	c
inventions	c
have	c
been	c
accelerated	c
by	c
electricity	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
electricity	c
in	c
many	c
different	c
ways	c
.	c

At	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
study	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c
and	i
also	i
It	i
saves	c
my	c
time	c
which	c
would	c
be	c
used	c
up	c
for	NA
doing	c
housework	c
such	c
as	c
laundry	c
,	c
cleaning	c
rooms	c
and	c
ironing	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
my	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
that	i
without	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
feel	c
that	c
electricity	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
any	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
electricity	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
changed	c

On	c
the	c
day	i
free	i
before	c
catch	i
our	c

We	c

One	c
is	c
a	c

question	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
lifes	i
,	c
may	i
be	i
,	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
without	c
electricity	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
are	i
using	i
different	c
equipments	i
in	c
our	c
houses	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
the	NA
electricity	c
.	c

Small	c
things	c
but	c
very	c
importants	i
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
T.V.	c
,	c
computer	c
,	c
just	c
light	c
and	c
a	c
long	c
list	c
that	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
write	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tinking	i
,	NA
my	c
house	c
of	i
my	c
life	c
,	NA
without	c
all	c
this	i
facilities	c
.	c

In	c
winter	c
when	c
is	i
dark	c
very	c
early	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
spent	i
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
home	c
.	c

What	c
I	i
can	i
do	c
without	c
my	c
music	c
and	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
just	i
you	i
need	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
do	c
or	c
what	c
would	c
happen	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
aeroplans	i
,	c
shoops	i
,	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
without	c
lights	c
.	c

Finally	c
.	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
know	i
that	c
the	NA
electricity	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
invent	i
and	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

to	c
do	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
,	c
there	c

I	c
recommend	c

the	c
centre	c
of	c
our	c

because	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c

I	c

and	c
if	c

have	c
some	c
doubts	i
,	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
hestitate	i
to	c
contact	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
our	c
lives	c
is	i
becoming	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
great	c
inventions	c
has	i
been	c
invented	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
people	c
live	c
comfortablely	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
television	c
.	c

\"	c
Televisions	i
is	c
just	c
an	c
amazing	c
invention	c
.	c
\"	c
My	c
good	c
friend	c
said	c
that	c
.	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
televisions	c
make	i
us	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
without	c
travel	i
it	c
all	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
are	i
no	c
televisions	c
,	c
we	c
wo	i
n't	c
know	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
other	i
countries	i
like	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
what	c
language	c
they	c
speak	c
unless	c
we	c
go	i
to	c
that	c
country	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	i
some	c
points	i
,	c
it	c
can	c
educate	c
young	c
children	c
.	c

Many	c
TV	c
programmes	c
are	c
especially	i
made	c
for	c
children	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
\"	c
Learn	c
follow	i
me	i
\"	c
and	c
\"	c
Be	c
good	i
to	i
others	i
\"	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
good	c
programmes	c
and	c
helped	c
me	c
know	i
what	c
I	c
should	c
do	c
generally	c
or	c
how	c
to	c
behave	c
nicely	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
still	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

The	i
last	i
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
kind	c
of	c
entertainments	i
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
will	NA
think	c
that	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	i
going	c
to	c
cinemas	c
and	c
discos	c
are	c
much	c
better	c
that	i
staying	c
at	c
home	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
an	c
object	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
televisions	c
can	c
bring	c
you	c
the	c
fun	c
that	c
other	c
activities	c
ca	c
n't	c
.	c

If	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
lonely	c
,	c
that	i
's	c
easy	c
,	c
just	i
turn	c
on	c
the	c
television	c
and	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everything	c
has	c
its	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
think	c
televisions	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
your	c

information	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
he	c
booked	c
the	c

Hotel	c
in	c
downtown	i
.	i

When	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
bus	c
or	c
a	c
taxi	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommend	c

Because	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beatiful	i
trees	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c

By	c
the	c

dinner	c
and	c
drinks	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
too	c
formal	c
party	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
wear	c
what	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommend	c
'	i
City	c
tour	c
'	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
.	c

Everybody	c
an	i
enjoy	c
themselves	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
£	c
12	c
each	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
reduction	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
tip	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
contact	c
with	NA
me	c
any	i
time	i
.	c

And	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
and	c
send	c
my	c
regard	i
to	c
Richard	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
inventions	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
make	c
us	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
convenient	i
.	c

Moreover	c
we	c
can	c
not	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
electricity	c
,	c
computer	i
,	c
telephon	i
,	c
boat	c
,	c
and	c
car	c
(	c
wheel	c
)	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

None	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
unimportant	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
electricity	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
among	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
electric	c
things	c
.	c

Electricity	c
could	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
invent	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
gave	c
us	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
women	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
abosolutly	i
reduced	c
women	c
's	c
our	NA
house	i
working	i
time	c
.	c

Evenmore	i
we	i
can	i
enjoy	i
our	i
night	i
with	c
lights	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
do	i
something	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
at	c
night	c
same	i
as	c
day	i
.	c

Finally	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
is	c
changed	c
by	c
electricity	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
reduce	c
our	c
working	c
time	c
and	c
make	c
us	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
advancing	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
better	i
future	c
!	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
imagined	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
drive	c
electric	i
car	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
describe	c
the	c
Haunted	c
Castle	c
in	c
Camberley	c
.	c

Place	c

This	c
castle	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
and	c
surrounded	c
by	c
woods	c
.	c

Inside	i
of	c
the	c
castle	c
is	c
always	c
dark	c
even	c
in	c
daytime	i
.	c

Story	c

It	c
is	c
500	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
haunted	c
by	c
a	c
lady	c
ghost	c
.	c

She	c
appears	c
occationaly	i
and	c
opens	c
every	c
window	c
in	c
the	c
castle	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
nanny	c
who	c
worked	c
there	c
and	c
fell	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

People	c
said	c
she	c
was	c
seeking	c
something	c
and	c
still	i
seeking	c
even	i
if	i
she	c
had	i
dead	c
for	c
500	c
years	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

The	c
ghost	c
story	c
may	c
not	c
be	c
true	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
good	c
furniture	c
of	i
16th	i
century	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
castle	c
itself	c
is	c
very	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	i
while	i
to	i
see	i
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
visiting	i
there	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
leader	c
of	c
the	c
group	c

Welcome	c

This	c
report	c
is	c

on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
,	NA
for	NA
your	c
students	c
to	NA
visit	NA
.	c

This	c
building	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
Taipei	c
,	c
the	c
capital	c
.	c

The	c
building	c
is	c
called	c
Chiang	i
Kei	c
-	c
shek	c
Momerial	i
Hall	c
.	c

Nearly	c
everyone	c
knows	c
where	c
this	c
building	c
is	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
,	c
just	c
ask	c
the	c
local	c
people	c
in	c
Taipei	c
about	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

The	c
momerial	i
Hall	c
is	c
surrounded	c
by	c
large	c
playgrounds	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
main	c
Hall	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
a	c
huge	c
statue	c
of	c
Chiang	c
Kei	c
-	c
shek	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
because	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
the	c
rememberence	i
of	c
how	c
well	c
Chiang	c
did	c
in	c
History	c
.	c

The	c
statue	c
is	c
about	c
20	c
feet	c
high	c
.	c

Next	i
to	i
the	i
statue	c
is	c
protected	c
by	c
the	NA

,	i
the	i

the	c
main	c
Hall	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
lots	c
of	c
other	c

In	c
these	c
gallaries	i
there	c
are	c
Historical	c
paintings	c
,	i
antique	c
furnitures	i
which	c
Chiang	c
used	c
.	c

These	c
treasure	i
are	c
very	c
old	c
,	c
even	c
older	c
than	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
America	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
treasures	c
were	c
brought	c
over	c
to	c
Taiwan	c
by	c
Chiang	c
during	c
the	c
defeat	c
in	c
China	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
all	c
been	i
well	c
look	i
after	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c

historical	c
paintings	c
...	c

There	i
are	c
also	c
restaurent	i
's	i
and	c
modern	c
gallaries	i
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
tired	c
after	c
looking	c
around	c
you	c
might	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
drinks	c
or	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
historical	c
thing	i
,	c
you	c
migh	i
as	c
well	c
just	c
pop	c
into	c
the	c
modern	c
gallery	c
to	c
see	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
modern	c
.	c

Finally	c

building	c
I	c

to	c
give	c
further	i
informations	i
on	c
an	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
in	c
Lausanne	c

It	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
my	c

experience	c

WHY	c
THE	c
OLYMPIC	c
MUSEUM	c
.	c

The	c
Olympique	i
Museum	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
the	c
lake	c
and	c
offer	i
,	c
for	c
the	c
tourist	c
,	c
an	c
unbelievable	c
view	c
on	i
the	c
mountains	c
and	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
,	NA
the	c
museum	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
gardens	c
with	c
several	c
statues	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
the	c
architecture	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
beautiful	c
and	c
very	c
modern	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
interest	c
of	c
the	c
museum	c
is	c
the	NA
olympic	i
history	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
documentary	i
about	c
it	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
several	c
competitors	c
personal	c
objects	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
play	c
with	NA
several	c
interactive	c
game	i
and	c
learn	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
olympic	i
games	c
.	c

REASONS	c
OF	i
RECOMMENDATION	c
.	c

The	c
principal	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
cheapest	i
price	c
.	c

You	c
pay	c
only	c
to	c
FRS	c
for	c
the	NA
entry	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
stay	c
in	NA
all	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
you	i
are	c
more	c
than	c
10	c
people	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
have	i
a	c
group	c
price	c
and	c
pay	c
only	c
6	c
Frs	c
per	c
person	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
that	c
this	c
solution	i
might	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
visit	c
this	c
museum	c
.	c

CONCLUSION	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
Olympic	c
Museum	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
attractive	c
place	c
and	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
trip	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
or	c
your	c
student	c
group	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
Olympic	c
Games	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
place	c
for	c
this	i
.	c

Dear	c
Maria	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
for	i
this	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	i
for	i
Richard	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	i
him	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c
of	i
health	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	i
can	c
perfectly	c
replace	c
it	i
to	c
lead	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
you	c
should	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
booked	c
into	c
the	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
that	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
.	c

The	c
access	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
place	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
walk	c
down	c
to	NA
the	NA
Central	c
Street	c
until	c
you	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
bus	c
stop	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
take	c
the	c
bus	i
number	i
two	i
that	c
goes	c
directly	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
that	c
is	c
organised	i
by	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
at	c
twenty	i
o'clock	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
be	c
ready	i
!	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
special	c
thema	i
for	i
the	i
wearing	i
style	i
but	c
it	c
should	i
be	c
more	c
fun	c
if	c
you	c
wear	c
something	c
crazy	c
...	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
propose	i
you	c
to	NA
go	c
to	c
the	c
new	c
college	c
swimmingpool	i
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
afternoon	i
.	c

Every	i
body	i
will	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
fun	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Hello	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
informations	i
on	c
the	NA
yverdon	i
's	c
castle	c
.	c

This	c
building	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
oldest	c
that	c
stays	i
in	c
the	c
landscape	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
its	i
important	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
there	i
because	c
it	c
shows	c
us	c
how	c
the	c
town	c
had	i
been	i
developped	i
around	c
it	c
since	c
its	c
creation	c
.	c

Those	i
days	c
,	c
the	c
castle	c
is	c
being	c
remade	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
construction	c
engines	i
around	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
because	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
complete	c
museum	c
in	i
it	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
old	c
pictures	c
of	c
the	c
castle	c
during	i
the	c
centuries	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
old	c
items	c
that	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
King	c
's	c
family	c
.	c

You	c
should	i
have	c
probably	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
mummy	c
who	c
sleeps	i
there	c
for	c
about	c
two	c
thousand	c
years	c
...	c
You	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
dungeon	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
everywhere	c
you	c
want	c
with	c
or	c
without	c
a	c
guide	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
the	c
visit	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
a	c
nice	c
holliday	i
in	c
Yverdon	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
booked	c
the	c
Five	c
-	c
Stars	i
Hotel	c
for	c
your	c
group	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
modern	c
hotel	c
,	c
near	c
our	c
college	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
convenent	i
to	i
come	i
from	i
the	c
airport	c
.	c
You	c
can	c
take	c
both	i
by	NA
buses	i
or	c
taxies	c
.	c

The	c
nember	i
101	c
bus	c
starts	i
from	c
the	c
airport	c
,	c
than	i
you	c
can	c
get	c
off	c
from	i
\"	i
city	c
college	c
\"	c
stop	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	i
tark	i
part	i
in	i
the	i
party	i
for	i
everyone	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
relaxing	c
party	c
,	c
just	c
for	i
the	c
members	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
make	c
friends	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	NA
wear	c
a	c
dress	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
free	i
three	i
hours	c
,	c
my	c
personal	c
prefer	i
to	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Our	c
city	c
has	c
got	c
the	c
biggest	c
shoping	i
centre	c
in	c
South	c
England	c
,	i
there	i
gathers	i
so	c
many	c
shops	c
.	c

It	c
worthes	i
tp	i
spend	i
time	c
and	c
money	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowdays	i
people	c
have	c
become	c
used	c
to	c
watching	c
televesion	i
's	i
programs	i
everyday	i
.	c

The	c
TV	c
is	c
so	c
important	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	i
in	c
every	c
family	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	i
essential	c
equipment	i
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
al	i
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
TV	c
has	c
a	c
great	c
education	i
functions	i
,	c
and	c
also	i
makes	c
the	c
world	c
become	NA
small	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
just	c
sit	c
at	c
home	c
then	i
you	c
can	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
at	c
the	i
moment	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
watching	i
the	c
news	c
on	c
TV	c
in	i
stead	i
of	c
reading	c
in	i
newspaper	c
or	c
hearing	i
on	i
radio	i
because	c
the	c
news	c
on	c
TV	c
are	i
vivid	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
TV	c
is	c
a	NA
great	c
company	c
for	c
the	NA
people	c
who	c
live	c
alone	c
or	c
feel	c
alone	c
.	c
I	c
would	NA
like	c
to	c
open	i
TV	i
when	c
I	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Someone	c
are	i
talking	c
,	c
laughting	i
,	c
crying	c
on	c
there	c
,	c
so	c
join	c
them	c
,	i
you	i
will	c
feel	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
just	i
yourself	c
.	c

Some	c
TV	c
programs	i
are	c
enjouable	i
!	c

However	c
,	c
TV	c
also	c
has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
just	c
sitting	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
TV	i
for	c
hours	c
learn	i
nothing	c
,	c
or	c
no	c
more	i
talk	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
badest	i
influence	c
in	c
the	NA
society	c
.	c

In	c
clucsion	i
,	c
the	NA
TV	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disagvangtages	i
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
whole	c
advantages	i
is	i
greater	c
than	c
disadvantages	i
.	c

So	c
,	NA
but	NA
on	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
TV	c
still	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
and	c
important	c
invention	c
on	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
an	i
international	c
student	c
conference	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
King	i
Hotel	c
at	i
High	c
Street	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
following	i
the	c
rod	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
right	c
,	c
then	c
cross	c
the	c
zebra	c
crossing	c
to	c
the	c
opposite	c
side	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
walk	c
to	c
the	c
right	c
about	c
15	c
metres	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
conference	c
place	i
which	c
is	c
called	c
White	i
House	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
conference	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
International	c
Dinner	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
some	c
shows	c
from	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
.	c

As	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
special	c
conference	c
so	NA
you	c
could	c
wear	c
your	c
own	c
national	c
dress	c
to	c
present	i
your	c
country	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
you	c
could	c
spend	c
your	c
free	c
time	c
to	i
visit	i
our	c
town	c
hall	c
which	i
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
my	c
area	c
-	c
or	c
do	i
some	c
shopping	c
at	i
High	c
Street	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
please	c
contact	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Bill	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
an	NA
information	c
on	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	NA
visit	NA
.	c

It	c
is	c
called	c
Penrhyh	c
Castle	c
,	c
as	i
the	i
building	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
Wales	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
positive	c
side	c
,	c
you	c
and	c
the	c
group	c
will	c
be	c
abe	i
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
Welsh	c
art	i
works	i
which	c
are	c
presented	c
on	c
the	c
wall	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
door	c
and	c
some	c
furnitures	i
.	c

The	c
building	c
itself	c
looks	c
splendid	c
and	c
beautiful	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
find	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
such	c
as	c
walking	c
along	c
the	c
old	c
wooden	c
floor	c
which	c
causes	c
some	c
noise	c
.	c

And	c
some	c
old	c
toilets	c
might	c
look	c
awlful	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
my	c
recommendation	i
,	i
I	i
think	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
see	c
this	c
building	c
.	c

Because	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
and	c
compare	c
with	i
the	i
place	i
in	i
their	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
Wales	c
is	c
not	c
modern	c
like	c
America	c
,	c
so	NA
the	c
students	c
will	c
probably	c
get	c
the	i
idea	i
of	i
looking	c
back	NA
to	i
the	NA
old	c
things	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c
Smith	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
at	NA
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Richard	c
Brown	c
is	c
ill	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
reply	c
for	NA
giving	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
've	c
booked	c
Palace	c
Hotel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
Central	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
its	i
using	c
tube	i
because	c
it	c
takes	c
only	c
20	c
mininute	i
.	c

The	c
tube	c
is	c
2	i
line	i
which	c
is	c
red	c
colour	NA
.	c

And	c
your	c
speach	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
conference	c
party	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	NA
wear	c
at	c
least	c
,	c
semi	c
formal	c
wears	i
such	c
as	c
a	c
jacket	c
with	c
another	i
clothes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
which	c
could	c
spend	c
for	c
about	c
3	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
national	c
museum	c
in	c
my	c
area	c
.	c

The	c
museum	c
can	c
be	c
helpful	c
to	c
understand	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
history	c
and	c
art	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Computer	i

the	c

Some	c
people	c

the	NA
electricity	c
more	i
important	c
than	c
another	i
thingh	i

It	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
say	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
invention	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
say	c
computer	i
is	c
more	i
amazing	c
invention	c
rather	c
than	c
another	i
inventions	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
telephone	c
,	c
the	c
car	c
.	c

Recently	c
computer	i
is	i
really	c
necessary	c
and	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
manage	c
to	c
work	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	NA
for	c
bussiness	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
in	c
for	NA
my	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
contanct	i
with	NA
to	NA
my	c
friend	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
quite	c
helpful	c
by	NA
using	i
e	c
-	c
mail	c
.	c

Before	c
computer	i
had	c
been	c
invented	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
possibly	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
easily	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
contact	c
with	NA
to	NA
foreign	c
countries	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
's	c
time	c
to	c
make	c
new	c
system	i
which	c
makes	c
us	NA
use	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
simple	c
,	c
so	c
far	c
more	c
people	c
can	c
enjoy	c
computer	i
more	NA
than	c
before	c
.	c

Despite	c
amazing	i
invention	c
,	c
some	i
times	i
computer	i
makes	i
big	i
problem	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
millennium	i
bug	c
(	c
some	c
people	c
called	c
\"	i
2000	c
problem	c
\"	c
)	c
,	c
because	c
computer	i
not	i
flexible	c
enough	c
like	c
a	c
human	c

.	c

However	c
,	c
computer	i
is	c
worth	c

Of	c

it	c
is	c
a	c
pity	c
that	c
Mr.	c
Brown	c
has	c
been	c
ill	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
comeing	i
now	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
hotel	c
the	c
group	c
had	c
been	c
booked	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
the	c
Palace	c
hotel	i
,	c
about	c
a	c
mile	c
away	c
where	i
the	c
conference	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
,	NA
is	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
bus	i
number	i
7	i
.	c

The	c
bus	c
stop	c
is	c
opposite	c
the	c

You	c
will	c
leave	i
the	c
bus	c
at	c

,	c
Royal	c
gardens	i
\"	c

Turn	c
left	c
and	c
go	c
straight	c
to	i

there	c
is	c
the	i
house	c
number	c
18	c

This	c
is	c
our	c
college	c

You	c
wish	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
about	c
,	NA
,	NA
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
a	c
little	c
dinner	c
and	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
young	c
singers	c
will	c
surprise	c
us	c
by	i
their	c
songs	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	c
asked	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c
Do	c
not	c
bother	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
recommend	c
you	c
wearing	i
some	c
casual	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	c
a	NA
jeans	c
,	c
a	c
blouse	c
or	c
a	c
skirt	c
and	c
a	c
jacket	c
.	c

Donnot	i
forget	c
to	c
wear	c
a	c
pair	c
of	c
comfortable	c
shoes	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
change	c
it	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
give	i
you	c
some	c
advise	i
for	i
what	c
you	c
could	c
do	c
for	c
about	c
three	c
hours	c
.	c

Firstly	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
and	NA
interesting	c
museum	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
located	c
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
.	c

Furthemore	i
there	c
is	c
the	c
zoo	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
animals	c
,	c
located	c
to	NA
walk	i
within	i
five	i
minutes	i
.	c

Lastly	c
there	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
very	c
old	c
and	c
famous	c
church	c
,	c
with	c
many	c
coloured	c
windows	c
.	c

For	c
further	c
information	c
please	c
call	c
me	c
up	NA
.	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
an	c
interesting	c
conference	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
seeing	i
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
telephone	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
invention	c

In	c
my	c
early	c
childhood	c
my	c
mother	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
when	c
she	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
litte	i
girl	c
there	c
has	i
been	i
only	c
one	c
telephone	c
in	c
the	c
house	i
where	c
she	c
had	NA
lived	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
in	c
her	c
parents	c
'	c
appartement	i
.	c

The	c
neighbours	c
had	i
come	i
into	NA
to	c
make	c
their	c
calls	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
their	c
calls	c
.	c

Todays	i
nobody	c
could	c
imagine	c
such	c
a	c
situation	c
.	c

In	c
every	c
household	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
telephone	c
at	c
least	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
advantages	c
for	i
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
people	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
person	i
on	i
every	i
time	c
.	i
Be	i
it	c
:	NA
just	c
for	c
fun	c
or	c
also	NA
to	c
discuss	c
some	c
important	c
and	c
relevant	c
thins	i
.	c

Moreover	c
we	c
always	i
can	i
call	c
for	i
help	i
to	i
the	i
police	i
,	i
to	i
the	i
hospital	i
or	i
to	i
a	i
doctor	i
.	c

This	c
could	c
save	c
life	i
!	c

An	i
other	i
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
offices	c
,	c
firms	c
and	c
industries	c
could	c
not	c
further	NA
exist	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
big	c
disadvantage	c
.	c

All	c
people	c
know	c
this	c
situation	c
;	c
people	c
want	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
interrupted	c
,	c
maybe	c
they	c
are	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
talk	c
or	c
are	c
having	c
a	c
little	c
sleep	c
...	c
then	c
the	c
telephone	c
rings	c
...	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
desicion	i
how	c
to	c
react	c
now	c
.	c

Being	c
sincere	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
telephone	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
of	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
the	NA
mobile	c
phones	c
are	c
ringing	c
.	NA
everywhere	c
and	c
on	NA
every	i
time	c
.	c

Especially	c
youngsters	c
misuse	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
invention	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
this	c
invention	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
useful	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
how	c
to	NA
people	c
use	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
and	c
how	c
people	c
handle	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Maria	c

The	c
Hotel	i
is	c
near	c
the	c
station	c
and	c
is	c

\"	c
Grand	c
Placad	c
\"	c

When	c
you	c

you	c
take	c
the	c

for	i
Guildford	c
and	c
after	c
you	i
have	i
just	i
across	i
the	c
road	c
,	NA
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
station	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	i
confortable	i
hotel	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

From	c
there	c
to	c
the	c
conference	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
bus	i
number	i
50	i
,	c
that	i
stop	i
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	c
arrive	i

The	c
conference	c
is	c
organised	i
in	c
the	c
civic	c

so	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
simple	i
to	c
found	i
it	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
conference	i
there	c
is	c
a	c
party	c
a	c
perfect	c
opportunity	c
for	c
your	c
students	c
meet	i
new	c
friends	c
from	c
all	c
part	i
of	c
word	i
and	c
they	c
could	i
speak	i
about	c
their	c
experience	c
.	c

I	i
suggest	i
for	i
that	i
conference	i
to	i
wear	i
somenthing	i
very	c
confortable	i
but	c
elegant	c
,	i
the	i
organisation	c
want	i
for	NA
all	c
boys	i
wear	i
jacket	i
,	c
the	i
tie	c
is	c
not	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	i
rely	i
what	c
you	c
can	i
see	c
,	c
three	i
hours	i
I	i
think	i
is	i
not	i
enough	c
but	c
near	c
the	c
station	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	c
garden	i
popular	c
for	c
its	c
variety	c
of	c

.	c

If	c
I	c
found	i
somenthing	i

to	i
visit	c
in	c
three	c

I	c
call	i
you	c

The	c
best	c
building	c
you	c

the	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
more	i
important	c

that	i
area	c
for	i
its	c
architeture	i

It	c
is	c
somenthing	i
very	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
,	c

In	c
replied	i
of	i
your	c

,	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
give	c

some	c
advices	i

Concerning	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
the	c

not	c

so	c
you	c

see	c
indications	i
to	c

For	c
the	c
conference	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	NA
wear	c
a	c
beautiful	c
dress	c
,	c

of	c

.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
spare	c
time	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
walk	c
on	i
the	c
center	i
of	c
Poitiers	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c

I	c

The	c
building	c
called	c
in	c
French	c
\"	c
Le	c
Centre	c
Pompidou	c
\"	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
surprising	c
monument	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
modern	c
building	c
with	c
an	c
architecture	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
see	c
in	c
other	i
place	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
impressive	c
on	i
this	c
building	c
is	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
tubes	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
outside	c
and	c
inside	c
the	c
building	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
Pompidou	c
's	NA
center	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
different	c
expositions	i
on	c
different	c
themes	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
paintings	c
,	c
videos	c
and	c
sculptures	c
.	c

This	i
expositions	i
are	c
often	c
very	c
attractive	c
and	c
they	c
change	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

Another	c
good	c
point	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
there	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
an	c
extraordinary	c
view	c
on	i
the	c
city	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
visit	c
Paris	c
,	c
the	c
Pompidou	c
's	NA
center	i
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
building	c
to	c
visit	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
in	c
Paris	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
others	i
buildings	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Smith	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
international	c
student	c
conference	c
in	i
our	c
college	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
your	c
group	c
has	c
been	c
booked	c
into	c
Palace	i
Hotel	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
our	c
town	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
five	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
college	c
,	c
where	c
the	c
conference	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
best	c
choise	i
for	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
234	c
bus	c
.	c

The	c
bus	c
stop	c
you	i
should	c
get	c
off	c
is	c
called	c
\"	c
The	c
Green	c
Man	c
\"	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
-	c
of	c
-	c
conference	c
party	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
8:00	c
until	c
midnight	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
necessary	c
dress	c
code	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	NA
evening	c
dress	c
for	c
women	c
and	c
black	c
trousers	c
,	c
a	c
white	c
shirt	c
and	c
a	c
black	c
bow	c
tie	c
for	c
men	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
way	i
in	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
your	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
strongly	c
convinced	c
,	NA
that	c
you	c
should	c
visit	c
local	i
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
shopping	c
center	i
next	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
your	i
at	c
the	c
conference	c
and	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
it	NA
is	c
widely	c
known	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
different	c
and	c
important	c
things	c
were	c
invented	c
during	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
,	NA
that	c
the	NA
modern	c
society	c
have	i
created	c
the	c
demand	c
for	c
the	i
ability	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
the	NA
vast	c
amounts	c
of	c
information	c
.	c

Taking	c
it	i
into	c
consideration	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
the	i
priceless	c
invention	c
for	c
an	NA
accountants	c
,	c
designers	c
,	c
engineers	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	NA
on	NA
.	c

Another	c
point	i
in	i
favour	i
is	c
the	i
possibility	i
to	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

It	c
allows	c
you	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
information	c
\"	c
on	i
your	c
fingertips	c
\"	c
.	c

Also	c
not	c
least	c
importantly	c
is	c
the	c
role	c
of	c
computers	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
production	c
in	c
factories	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
children	c
nowadays	c
replace	c
their	c
real	c
life	c
with	c
the	i
virtual	c
world	c
,	NA
which	c
computers	c
create	c
.	c

Another	c
drawback	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
industry	c
computers	c
replace	c
people	c
's	c
labour	c
,	c
which	c
leads	c
to	c
the	NA
increasing	c
of	NA
unemployment	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
goverments	i
of	c
all	c
developed	c
countries	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
concerned	c
about	c
so	i
-	c
called	c
\"	c
problem	c
2000	c
\"	c
if	c
the	c
computer	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
the	NA
modern	c
society	c

Report	c
on	c
the	c
\"	c
Paintings	c
Museum	c
\"	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
write	c
this	c
report	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
hours	c
in	c
this	c
wonderful	c
museum	c
.	c

There	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
exibitions	i
and	c
admired	c
the	c
building	c
itself	c
.	c

I	c
walked	c
around	c
the	c
garden	c
too	c
.	c

Location	c

The	c
museum	c
is	c
located	c
in	c
Ouchy	c
,	c
in	i
front	i
of	i
the	c
\"	c
Delamuraz	c
Hotel	c
\"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
main	c
road	c
,	c
and	c
at	NA
300	c
meters	i
of	i
the	c
station	c
.	c

Outside	c

The	c
building	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
white	c
stones	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
two	c
floors	c
.	c

Before	c
going	c
inside	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pas	i
through	c
the	c
huge	c
garden	c
.	c

There	c
,	c
ponds	c
,	c
pools	c
,	c
trees	c
,	c
flowers	c
and	c
ducks	c
can	c
be	c
admired	c
.	c

I	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
your	c
swim	i
suit	i
,	c
because	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
allowed	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
pools	i
.	c

Inside	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
inside	c
the	c
museum	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
impressed	c
by	c
the	c
paintings	c
on	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

There	i
were	c
all	c
painting	i
during	c
the	c
war	c
by	c
nurses	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
down	c
a	c
few	c
steps	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
discover	c
the	c
ceilar	i
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
this	c
room	c
is	c
about	i
wine	c
.	c

To	c
learn	c
the	c
whole	c
history	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
room	c
dedicated	c
to	c
it	c
on	c
the	c
first	c
floor	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
\"	c
blue	c
\"	c
room	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
this	c
room	c
is	c
blue	c
,	c
the	c
carpet	c
,	c
the	c
ceiling	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
door	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
owner	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
room	c
where	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
people	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
depressed	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
this	c
house	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
in	c
our	c

You	c
should	c
come	c
and	c
visit	c
it	c
for	c
the	c
paintings	c
or	c
for	c
the	c
building	c
itself	c
.	c

You	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
negative	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
10	c
francs	c
to	c
visit	c
.	NA
the	c
house	c
and	c
the	c
garden	c
