After
75
years
old
men
do
approximately
10
times
less
exercises
than
theyy
used
to
do
at
the
age
of
16
.

It
is
crucial
to
mention
that
while
the
total
number
of
visits
(
accounted
for
350
million
)
in
1990
comprised
of
4
reasons
(
borrowing
/
returning
books
,
reading
newspapers
/
magazines
,
studying
and
finding
information
)
,
the
total
number
of
visits
(
290
million
)
in
2000
comprised
of
5
reasons
:
borrowing
and
returning
CDs
(
18
%
)
had
become
the
new
cause
for
going
to
the
library
.

Nevertheless
,
there
are
some
ways
which
can
help
to
reduce
or
avoid
these
health
problems
.

In
other
words
,
the
looking
is
a
key
to
developing
and
producing
.

Obviously
,
people
over
49
tend
to
study
due
to
their
own
interest
.

That
is
why
,
modern
technologies
are
developing
every
moment
.

The
following
pie
-
charts
provide
a
comparison
of
different
goods
'
transportation
in
Eastern
Europe
in
2008
.

In
this
case
,
not
all
countries
are
able
to
provide
their
population
with
commodities
domestically
.

The
uniform
rules
that
tell
pupils
about
how
they
should
behave
themselves
at
classes
and
so
on
…
it
happens
that
pupils
have
very
limited
freedom
.

Secondly
,
athlets
who
did
not
use
illegal
drugs
before
would
not
use
drugs
in
sport
as
their
collegues
.

I
,
myself
,
do
like
taking
photos
near
beautiful
buildings
.

From
the
other
hand
,
even
thought
there
are
will
be
more
sports
facilities
,
it
is
necessary
to
explain
people
why
sport
is
important
,
also
to
represent
them
the
utility
of
it
.

This
government
might
implement
special
programs
in
order
to
increase
the
number
of
sport
facilities
.

Compered
to
goods
transported
by
rail
the
ones
transported
by
road
had
another
structure
.

Therefore
,
importing
food
products
can
be
a
great
solution
.

In
my
opinion
,
a
building
is
created
not
only
to
let
people
use
it
for
different
things
but
also
to
be
a
part
of
our
culture
.

Furtermore
,
professional
sports
are
just
about
hardworking
and
leaving
the
cheating
athletes
in
professional
sports
,
even
after
2
years
of
banning
,
would
be
a
disrespect
of
lifelong
work
of
those
,
who
never
used
illegal
drugs
and
achieved
high
result
by
their
own
forces
.

There
are
some
suggestions
of
the
ways
of
its
improving
,
and
one
of
them
is
increasing
the
number
of
sport
facilities
.

Nevertheless
,
this
is
not
the
easiest
way
to
solve
the
problem
as
it
is
quite
complicated
to
create
.

So
when
we
are
helping
people
in
difficult
situations
,
for
example
sending
food
and
water
when
needed
,
or
welcoming
refugees
from
countries
in
war
time
,
we
develop
a
bond
with
them
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
method
can
be
not
successful
,
since
there
is
possibility
of
making
the
situation
worse
by
constant
reminding
how
to
live
.

On
the
one
hand
,
people
should
work
well
to
rest
well
,
and
they
can
do
it
almost
only
thanks
to
their
money
.

As
a
consequence
young
generation
will
not
see
and
know
building
of
last
century
.

Moving
to
the
UK
we
can
notice
that
the
general
population
almost
entirely
consists
of
white
citizens
and
the
percentage
of
them
reaches
a
peak
at
88
.

The
statistics
shows
that
happy
people
have
much
longer
and
brighter
life
than
lonely
and
angry
people
.

For
example
,
adults
aged
18
-
25
decreased
their
participation
in
the
education
sector
,
but
people
aged
26
-
35
increased
their
activity
according
to
the
information
given
in
this
table
for
1998
and
2006
.

To
conclude
,
downloading
and
sharing
films
and
music
on
the
Internet
,
instead
of
buying
the
original
discs
is
illigal
and
people
who
do
it
should
be
punished
.

But
on
the
other
hand
increasing
of
number
of
sport
facilities
may
do
not
improve
people
's
health
.

In
the
Middle
East
the
percent
of
unemployment
fall
to
9,6
in
2015
.

To
my
mind
,
there
should
not
be
official
restrictions
from
our
government
,
but
there
should
be
inner
moral
rules
about
what
somebody
can
or
can
not
do
.

Speaking
about
worldwide
experience
,
Hollywood
movie
makers
have
been
working
so
hard
to
stop
pirate
copies
.

Actually
some
people
are
sure
that
if
the
government
increases
the
quantity
of
places
for
doing
sport
,
the
aim
stated
will
be
reached
,
other
think
there
are
lots
of
other
ways
in
deciding
this
problem
.

If
they
stop
to
import
food
they
can
lose
a
great
opportunity
to
develop
it
's
economy
.

There
are
some
arguments
that
can
support
this
point
of
view
.

Nowadays
some
people
tend
to
agree
that
looking
beautiful
is
not
the
main
purpose
of
a
building
,
because
it
should
be
practical
,
so
architects
should
not
take
into
account
producing
art
.

Manufactured
goods
by
rail
is
the
same
amount
as
by
road
,
Machinery
transported
by
road
has
minimal
percent
in
second
chart
.

However
,
many
others
who
consider
that
earning
money
is
not
that
important
,
and
prefer
to
have
more
opportunity
to
enjoy
their
lesure
time
.

However
,
watching
TV
or
using
electric
tools
have
no
correlation
with
weather
have
with
hours
.

The
presented
chart
and
table
illustrate
obesity
rates
among
children
;
physical
acrivity
rates
of
children
who
exsercised
regularly
.

The
graph
shows
information
about
proportions
of
population
aged
65
and
over
for
three
countries
:
Japan
,
Sweden
and
the
USA
.

In
contrast
,
the
weather
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
remains
rather
stable
during
the
whole
year
.

In
our
modern
sport
field
it
is
a
widespread
tendenton
to
using
illegal
drugs
before
the
competition
.

The
scientists
hope
that
the
government
can
make
a
desision
with
the
unhealthy
people
by
some
methods
,
for
example
to
increase
the
number
of
sport
center
or
do
it
more
comfortable
.

They
serve
different
needs
beginning
from
shelter
to
a
person
and
finishing
with
entertainment
centres
.

It
their
needs
and
ambitions
,
perfectly
and
encourages
development
dynamic
of
both
of
them
.

There
are
several
possible
causes
of
this
development
.

I
think
that
it
is
more
important
to
have
free
time
and
have
work
that
earned
money
,
and
work
that
you
realy
like
and
enjoy
.

In
my
opinion
,
it
is
also
significant
to
build
beautiful
and
impresssive
constructions
,
so
this
essay
will
disagree
with
these
statements
.

Oh
no
,
we
just
like
these
geometric
patterns
in
forms
and
white
space
around
circle
.

We
still
have
a
privellige
to
observe
all
the
wealth
of
culture
developing
from
our
ancient
parents
.

As
expected
,
after
July
the
temperature
goes
into
a
decline
,
steadily
going
down
until
December
.

The
given
diagram
represents
how
was
changing
the
percent
of
the
population
aged
over
65
years
in
the
period
from
1940
to
2040
in
Japan
,
Sweden
,
and
USA
.

To
conclude
,
drugs
,
specially
in
sport
,
are
always
wrong
decision
for
people
who
want
to
live
without
any
problems
with
life
and
professional
success
,
have
to
reject
from
drugs
in
any
form
.

Every
single
person
works
to
acquire
goods
such
as
food
,
clothes
,
vehicles
,
gadgets
and
more
.

The
most
profitable
production
of
print
books
in
2014
was
in
the
USA
.

So
to
cope
with
this
problem
there
is
a
need
in
educating
people
and
popularisating
some
modern
resercies
.

In
general
,
all
health
desiases
caused
by
modern
techuologies
were
caused
by
ouer
-
use
of
this
technologies
and
useing
it
in
anpropriate
way
.

The
first
sector
,
hotel
&
catering
,
shows
that
this
industry
was
mostly
chosen
by
people
of
26
-
35
and
36
-
45
age
groups
in
2006
though
in
1998
it
was
more
popular
between
younger
ages
(
18
-
23
)
.

But
it
may
have
some
disadvantages
.

Secondly
,
it
is
known
that
humans
need
a
veriety
of
vitamins
contained
in
their
meals
to
stay
healthy
,
Sometimes
,
because
of
the
climate
countries
are
not
able
to
grow
all
the
food
that
a
mans
'
organism
needs
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
answer
to
this
question
is
definetely
yes
.

Number
of
young
people
in
Yemen
is
larger
than
in
Italy
on
about
35,8
%
,
but
number
of
retired
people
in
Yemen
is
little
,
only
3,6
%
,
while
in
Italy
is
14,3
%
in
2000
.

I
personally
think
that
building
new
sports
facilities
is
a
good
measure
.

To
sum
up
,
I
think
it
is
better
to
work
with
people
's
minds
and
make
them
understand
pluses
of
doing
sport
instead
of
building
new
sport
facilities
,
because
the
latter
will
influence
people
,
but
not
so
,
efficiently
as
learning
them
to
live
healthy
lives
.

All
the
aformentioned
factors
result
into
yound
people
growing
up
very
violent
,
which
is
one
of
the
key
factors
of
the
increase
in
the
number
of
crimes
committed
by
young
people
.

Maybe
because
of
these
facts
people
choose
not
to
buy
original
copy
but
to
download
for
free
.

Due
to
the
principles
of
the
International
law
there
could
not
be
any
discrimination
.

During
the
first
half
of
the
year
the
average
temperature
in
Yakutsk
soars
to
the
top
level
just
more
then
20
degree
,
while
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
the
average
temperature
remain
staible
only
reaching
maximum
in
30
degrees
in
January
.

Most
of
teachers
,
for
instance
,
who
teach
literary
studies
are
male
ones
.

People
now
know
how
to
manage
with
dangers
of
the
nature
.

This
issue
has
recently
risen
loads
of
dispites
as
the
citizens
are
not
always
agree
with
such
a
policy
and
want
all
the
attention
to
be
inclined
to
their
motherland
only
.

Overall
,
the
sutiation
in
all
three
counties
has
changed
(
the
population
aged
65
has
encreased
)
,
the
biggest
chanching
were
happend
with
Japan
.

Any
people
believe
that
the
creation
of
artists
should
be
have
a
cencure
.

In
the
USA
it
will
be
for
3
billion
US
Dollars
.

The
main
difference
between
two
charts
is
that
the
number
non
-
white
prison
people
in
the
USA
is
higher
than
in
the
UK
.

Architects
have
always
tried
to
make
churches
as
beutiful
as
they
could
because
the
main
purpose
of
the
church
is
to
create
the
atmosphere
of
different
,
divine
world
,
world
that
is
greater
and
better
than
this
one
on
the
Earth
.

People
who
are
under
26
think
about
career
(
80
%
)
,
but
in
over
49
age
students
do
n't
think
about
it
so
much
(
only
18
%
)
.

Speaking
about
the
most
popular
countries
visited
by
the
UK
residents
in
1999
it
is
to
point
out
that
France
and
Spain
were
visited
most
frequently
.

The
charts
illustrate
the
most
importants
reasons
for
study
among
people
of
various
ages
and
the
amount
of
support
they
have
got
from
their
employers
.

To
begin
with
,
the
most
obvious
reason
for
overwhelming
popularity
of
American
and
British
films
is
globalisation
.

Young
persons
are
the
main
users
of
these
ones
.

Therefore
,
producers
and
musicians
have
a
great
revenue
not
only
from
their
content
sold
officially
,
but
also
from
participating
in
festivals
,
giving
interviews
and
advertising
goods
.

Winters
units
fluctuated
between
30000
and
more
than
40000
.

However
,
can
be
that
female
students
will
have
non
good
results
in
the
end
of
the
course
.

There
is
a
widespread
issue
in
many
countries
about
students
behaviour
.

For
example
,
in
the
last
three
years
Russia
did
a
few
unsuccessful
experiments
with
cargo
spacecrafts
(
one
of
them
was
\"
Progress
\"
)
.

In
my
view
,
currently
,
downloading
music
,
watching
illegal
pirate
copies
and
sharing
it
with
other
Internet
accounts
is
the
type
of
communication
,
which
becomes
the
normal
action
and
norm
at
all
.

The
second
chart
given
shows
that
nearly
a
half
of
women
consider
sharing
photos
and
videos
via
Facebook
among
the
main
reasons
for
its
using
,
whereas
men
see
this
reason
equally
important
to
the
ability
of
recieving
updates
.

In
such
situations
architects
should
worry
about
inside
plan
of
buildings
.

Also
if
you
spend
too
much
time
sitting
by
the
TV
or
playing
games
,
or
working
on
computer
can
cause
you
decreasing
your
eyes
health
and
even
damage
them
so
much
that
you
can
lose
your
focus
.

Its
variety
of
definitions
is
as
wide
as
the
amount
of
people
on
the
Earth
,
and
often
give
it
prior
importance
in
our
lives
.

This
essay
will
discuss
argument
about
that
question
.

In
developing
countries
people
can
count
only
on
the
fairness
of
local
businesses
.

I
am
positively
sure
that
students
must
be
able
to
enroll
in
a
certain
class
not
for
gender
reasons
but
judjing
on
their
intellectual
abilities
,
which
can
be
measured
by
standartised
and
objective
tests
.

To
my
mind
,
such
people
should
be
punished
.

All
in
all
,
although
in
some
countries
the
youth
are
encouraged
to
have
a
gap
year
,
every
person
should
make
a
decision
himself
which
will
bw
thw
most
suitable
for
him
.

But
this
problem
can
be
solved
.

As
result
,
country
will
depend
of
other
countries
and
in
any
global
problem
it
will
affect
significantly
on
all
population
.

Nowadays
private
companies
have
forces
for
researching
the
scientific
sphere
and
investing
in
its
development
while
government
engaged
in
this
process
less
.

All
in
all
,
I
'm
totally
agree
that
introducing
of
sporst
facilities
will
increase
a
level
of
population
's
health
,
but
also
if
people
will
be
combine
a
sport
lifestyle
with
healthy
food
it
would
have
a
huge
effect
on
the
main
target
as
a
public
health
.

Goverments
of
our
cities
do
not
spent
so
much
money
on
producing
films
.

I
agree
with
this
statement
.

Users
just
download
the
choosen
film
and
can
watch
it
any
time
.

Because
eastern
countries
can
offer
lots
of
fruits
and
vegetables
which
are
rare
for
Russia
but
very
popular
between
Russian
people
.

There
are
two
graphs
which
show
us
average
temperatures
of
two
different
countries
and
cities
:
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

In
my
opinion
,
sport
is
life
and
we
should
relate
to
this
more
attentively
then
now
.

But
after
2020
we
see
the
rocketing
of
japan
's
old
population
from
7
to
28
percents
.

The
picture
demonstrates
an
information
about
the
underground
railway
system
in
six
different
cities
.

Goverments
should
fund
those
aspects
of
social
life
in
order
to
bring
up
healthy
and
intellegent
generations
,
thus
,
they
may
develop
the
country
in
the
future
.

There
is
a
study
which
told
us
that
features
of
character
which
we
born
with
have
a
very
important
role
in
people
self
-
development
and
the
future
of
every
person
strongly
depends
on
them
.

All
things
which
he
did
,
he
did
great
,
but
he
was
very
lazy
,
because
he
accustomed
that
all
things
he
can
get
without
hard
working
.

First
,
Yakutsk
has
got
the
same
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
in
summer
.

All
in
all
,
personaly
,
I
believe
that
proper
education
is
a
true
cure
to
hemanity
's
problems
.

Although
,
the
kilometres
of
route
reach
a
high
point
also
in
London
's
system
.

Moreover
,
the
hectic
life
of
today
may
also
be
another
cause
of
students
'
bad
behaviour
.

This
thought
may
be
valid
,
but
for
the
economy
the
concurence
is
the
major
starting
point
.

This
explains
why
people
demand
for
more
electricity
in
winter
than
in
summer
.

By
contrast
,
in
Europe
achieving
happiness
means
career
success
or
good
family
relations
of
a
concret
person
.

January
and
July
are
the
coldest
months
of
Yakutsk
and
Rio
relativly
.

Although
the
metals
which
had
a
big
differences
in
percentage
between
transportation
by
rail
and
road
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
I
suppose
that
it
's
possible
for
nowadays
combine
these
two
factors
.

Moreover
,
if
person
cheated
and
than
caught
,
it
is
not
very
significant
how
many
years
he
will
be
banned
,
because
for
all
people
he
will
be
cheater
forever
.

If
people
want
to
improve
their
health
,
they
should
remember
about
healthy
diet
.

It
can
not
be
said
about
other
countries
,
in
which
constant
growth
or
constant
fall
can
be
noticed
.

SO
,
in
my
opinion
,
social
environment
is
very
crucial
for
person
's
development
and
can
easily
affect
and
even
shape
our
personalities
.

As
it
can
be
seen
from
the
bar
chart
,
printed
books
in
the
USA
made
up
the
largest
propotion
while
in
the
Uk
these
books
accounted
for
the
smallest
fraction
in
2014
.

It
would
be
a
great
opportunity
to
start
the
life
from
the
very
beginning
.

It
's
quite
clear
that
often
the
real
factor
is
a
great
secret
,
hard
to
tell
it
to
others
,
or
it
's
difficultly
achievable
,
Kare
or
somethnig
else
.

Then
,
it
is
decreasing
until
2025
.

Individuals
spending
many
hours
in
front
of
computers
'
monitors
tend
to
wear
glasses
.

There
will
be
a
tremendous
fall
of
printed
books
production
in
2018
(
10,5
to
7,5
)
.

This
graph
shows
us
the
percentage
of
the
population
over
65
between
1940
and
2040
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
USA
.

Nevertheless
,
others
think
that
health
is
the
most
valuable
factor
.

The
main
reason
for
using
it
among
men
is
sharing
photos
and
videos
(
39
%
)
and
receiving
updates
(
39
%
,
and
for
women
the
percentage
is
the
same
)
.

Amount
of
time
spent
on
sport
falls
from
115
to
10
minutes
.

Some
people
tend
to
think
that
universities
can
destroy
problem
of
gender
by
accepting
the
same
number
of
male
and
female
.

As
I
think
,
people
download
films
illegally
because
they
wo
n't
spent
money
in
order
to
watch
films
at
home
.

In
USA
and
Sweden
there
were
periods
of
decline
too
-
from
1980
to
1990
and
from
1980
to
2014
respectively
.

Some
people
prefer
to
earn
more
money
and
have
less
free
time
.

It
has
to
be
tipical
,
and
quiete
simple
.

Although
,
it
is
not
honest
,
when
someone
buy
original
discs
or
songs
,
for
example
,
on
app
stor
,
when
other
people
get
it
for
free
.

In
addition
The
second
biggest
sectors
of
diagrams
show
percentage
of
manufactured
goods
delievered
,
and
it
is
almost
equal
for
each
kind
of
transportation
.

Many
artists
suffer
from
free
internet
downloads
of
their
masterpieces
,
but
those
who
download
free
music
of
free
films
not
always
are
ready
to
pay
for
those
.

In
modern
time
happiness
is
the
most
important
thing
for
many
people
.

Firstly
,
the
most
important
fact
for
me
is
that
all
the
students
have
equal
chanses
while
entering
the
university
.

The
majority
of
electricity
(
52,5
%
)
is
spent
on
heating
rooms
and
water
.

The
next
is
London
underground
sistem
which
is
also
known
as
\"
tube
\"
with
775
millions
of
passengers
.

This
issue
has
n't
died
yet
and
debates
about
difference
of
sexes
exist
in
many
social
arias
,
for
example
,
in
universities
.

This
provides
us
with
the
best
products
.

THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
WAY
NOT
ONLY
FOR
PARENTS
AND
TEACHERS
BUT
FOR
THE
GOVERMENT
TOO
IS
GENTRIFICATION
.

Regardless
,
the
life
experience
can
be
easily
forgotten
and
dodged
because
it
can
be
a
conflict
of
experiences
.

Nowadays
World
wide
web
plays
a
significant
role
in
humans
life
.

Also
,
when
woman
wants
to
study
something
\"
male
\"
,
it
will
be
difficult
to
do
by
herself
.

The
supportes
of
first
position
usually
gives
an
examples
of
comparison
between
thieves
,
who
can
steel
films
and
break
the
law
as
well
.

And
most
of
us
would
agree
that
this
is
all
because
of
artists
,
who
learned
how
to
convey
to
the
masses
their
vision
.

I
believe
,
such
opportuinity
schould
not
be
punished
and
websites
with
files
have
to
be
opened
for
all
.

But
there
is
a
question
if
they
should
be
punished
.

They
show
how
many
users
use
Facebook
by
desktop
or
by
mobile
in
2012
and
in
2013
.

This
observation
reveals
a
different
pattern
of
attendance
in
the
science
and
the
arts
courses
.

The
most
striking
feature
is
that
in
Koyoto
it
is
only
22
kilometres
of
route
although
it
was
opened
20
years
earlier
contemporary
to
20s
ctngele
,
where
nowadays
there
are28
kilometres
of
route
.

The
authors
of
these
charts
chose
next
age
categories
:
18
-
25
year
olds
,
26
-
40
year
olds
and
40
years
old
and
above
.

Nowadays
many
people
say
that
it
is
unreal
to
provide
all
people
on
the
Earth
with
equal
conditions
,
that
is
why
local
authorities
should
concentrate
only
on
helping
inhabitants
of
their
own
states
.

To
sum
up
,
not
all
pirate
copies
bring
such
big
material
damages
to
producers
and
people
who
share
these
files
by
free
should
not
be
punished
because
of
their
good
desires
in
order
to
bring
the
possibility
free
watching
or
listening
video
or
music
materials
to
other
people
around
the
world
.

They
are
70
per
cent
.

The
pie
charts
also
show
that
the
percentage
of
people
,
who
visit
the
library
for
studying
in
1990
is
10
%
,
while
the
percentage
of
these
people
in
2000
is
2
%
,
which
is
five
times
less
.

The
second
that
we
can
notice
it
is
increasing
popularity
of
eBook
in
2018
.

Firstly
,
let
's
turn
to
the
table
.

All
our
society
should
understand
this
problem
and
think
about
the
solutions
.

Overall
,
we
can
observe
positive
changes
,
but
there
is
serious
problem
in
N.
Africa
.

And
in
2040
the
level
of
people
aged
65
and
over
will
the
same
in
every
countries
.

Overall
,
the
males
have
more
percentage
of
the
skilled
vocational
diploma
and
postgraduate
diploma
then
the
females
.

And
what
about
characteristics
?

On
the
one
hand
,
the
elemination
of
drugged
athletes
is
a
honest
way
of
punishment
.

It
can
lead
not
only
to
an
increase
of
illegal
actions
,
but
also
to
the
situation
when
all
people
may
consider
that
these
actions
are
normal
.

The
following
barchart
represents
statistics
of
book
market
in
four
big
countries
.

It
is
clear
that
the
print
marker
dropped
from
2014
,
comparing
with
2018
,
in
contrast
,
eBook
market
will
rose
.

Firstly
,
everyone
should
notice
that
after
every
wasted
our
behind
technics
some
physical
exercise
should
be
done
.

The
pie
charts
show
the
persentage
of
people
,
living
in
Yemen
and
Italy
according
to
comparison
in
age
level
in
2000
and
forecasts
for
2050
.

The
diagram
illustrates
how
the
unemployment
rate
changed
in
2014
and
2015
in
the
world
.

The
per
cent
of
metals
and
food
products
have
the
most
significant
difference
between
transported
by
rail
and
road
.

THE
LOWEST
RATE
IS
MACHINERY-2
%
.

Sometimes
\"
creative
\"
interprets
like
\"
new
and
progressive
\"
.

However
,
it
is
usually
clear
from
the
history
that
many
bounders
were
built
by
the
governments
ot
the
church
for
them
,
because
there
always
was
an
important
questiont
:
Might
the
artist
be
or
act
as
a
precursor
for
the
differend
problems
in
countries
,
such
us
crimes
or
violence
?

For
example
,
engeneering
seems
to
be
easy
for
male
,
especially
when
they
study
cars
,
while
women
more
often
need
a
couple
more
hours
to
understand
a
mechanism
.

Then
,
from
1980
to
2020
old
population
in
the
USA
remained
steady
,
about
15
%
,
steadily
rising
from
2020
to
2040
.

From
the
other
hand
,
the
incident
of
Pussy
Riot
became
known
to
the
whole
world
.

And
in
Europe
such
kind
of
things
are
prohibited
as
for
residents
and
citizencs
of
the
country
and
so
for
law
institutes
.

At
the
same
time
,
only
10
%
of
men
had
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

To
sum
up
,
I
can
not
agree
with
the
opinion
that
characteristics
we
born
with
are
more
importan
in
forming
the
personality
than
life
experience
.

Others
suppose
it
would
not
be
effecient
.

That
is
why
private
conpanies
are
dangerous
in
some
way
-
it
is
not
a
secret
that
some
of
them
are
sponsors
of
terrorists
organizations
thriving
all
over
the
world
.

Conversely
,
the
number
of
users
of
mobile
phones
had
a
significant
growth
during
that
year
,
in
2012
there
were
under
60
millions
,
but
in
2013
the
level
was
near
100
millions
.

The
same
situation
in
universities
and
the
measure
which
is
suggested
in
the
statement
will
never
be
a
reality
in
different
region
.

It
seems
to
me
that
government
should
offer
to
inhabitants
meal
:
that
its
country
produced
itself
.

There
are
some
solutions
to
this
problem
.

But
technological
inventions
in
future
can
help
not
only
to
decrease
the
influence
from
devices
,
but
also
to
cure
all
illnesses
and
diseases
which
people
have
already
.

Then
it
dicreases
to
40,000
and
falls
to
30,000
after
6
o'clock
.

And
last
but
not
least
as
South
Africa
,
with
the
same
rate
as
in
the
previous
year

Growing
up
and
having
to
survive
in
indifferent
or
even
hostive
world
these
people
try
to
reach
their
goals
with
any
means
possible
.

The
first
chart
belows
we
see
changes
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
some
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

When
people
have
more
free
time
on
their
hands
,
they
gather
together
,
support
their
team
and
communicate
.

The
main
argue
of
people
who
think
that
should
close
the
acsess
on
competision
for
professional
athlets
who
takes
illigal
drugs
during
limited
period
is
that
every
person
has
right
on
mistake
.

Today
there
are
some
specializations
in
universities
,
where
usually
study
only
men
or
only
women
for
example
:
in
the
University
of
Federal
Department
of
Safety
girls
can
be
accepted
only
on
the
Translated
Faculty
and
they
have
no
chance
to
attend
another
faculty
.

Some
people
say
,
that
solution
to
the
problem
is
increasing
the
number
of
sport
facilities
.

On
the
other
hand
,
specialists
that
used
to
work
in
small
businesses
could
be
invited
to
the
world
-
known
companies
and
present
their
ideas
there
.

The
line
graph
illustrated
the
percentage
of
elder
people
over
65
every
20
years
since
1940
till
2040
in
three
various
countries
.

There
is
a
popular
opinion
that
locally
produced
films
are
more
specific
for
the
country
where
they
were
produced
,
for
example
,
what
is
filmed
in
Balkan
countries
hardly
would
be
understanded
by
West
European
people
for
language
shifts
and
life
style
.

In
every
course
there
is
always
a
dominating
age
group
.

People
watch
films
as
they
want
to
see
celebraties
.

Comparing
the
two
graphs
we
notice
this
:
average
year
temperature
in
rio
is
almost
constant
,
comparing
to
Yakutsk
and
is
never
less
then
18
°
C
,
and
the
coldest
and
the
hottest
months
in
Rio
are
the
hottest
and
the
coldest
in
Yakutsk
.

As
for
the
lowest
temperature
in
Russia
it
is
nearly
-
40
°
C
in
January
and
in
Brasil
it
is
approximately
18
°
C
in
July
.

Overall
,
it
is
clear
that
printed
and
eBooks
markets
are
the
most
developed
among
these
countries
and
it
will
lead
in
2018
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
some
artists
which
do
not
know
any
limits
in
their
creativity
.

Comparing
the
data
,
it
is
necessary
to
mention
that
those
aged
from
18
to
25
mostly
studied
Science
courses
,
making
up
the
largest
part
of
all
participants
of
these
courses
-
55
%
.

Sportsmen
and
other
people
,
who
devotes
their
life
for
sport
,
often
obtaines
a
dangerous
traumas
.

We
have
a
telephone
,
laptop
,
notebook
,
personal
computer
special
glasses
,
iwatch
and
so
on
.

In
the
modern
world
the
health
problems
are
quite
important
for
population
and
it
is
necessary
to
find
solutions
for
such
problem
as
global
health
fall
.

Unfortunately
,
it
will
be
very
expensive
.

Many
people
think
that
this
is
not
cost
-
effective
.

The
reason
why
the
Earth
set
on
to
divide
in
small
fractions
is
due
to
that
it
is
impossible
to
control
all
of
the
territory
and
have
unite
community
,
thanks
to
quntative
feature
of
population
of
our
planet
.

During
centures
people
learnt
to
express
themselves
somehow
and
present
days
are
not
an
exception
.

It
very
inportan
for
people
,
because
we
need
vitamins
to
be
healthier
in
cold
winter
,
and
we
take
it
from
tropic
fruits
from
tropic
contries
such
as
Brasil
or
Moroko
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
there
is
always
a
compromise
between
saving
free
time
and
earning
a
lot
of
money
,
if
a
person
is
a
freelancer
,
for
example
.

The
number
of
unemployment
people
all
over
the
world
was
not
so
huge
.

Moreover
,
even
when
I
think
of
myself
,
I
realize
that
it
would
n't
be
that
easy
to
change
.

The
\"
Guaranteed
Basic
Income
\"
system
that
has
been
put
forward
by
some
governments
and
politicians
clearly
has
a
number
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
to
be
considered
and
taken
into
account
.

Many
people
say
that
the
wide
spread
use
of
modern
technology
is
causing
an
increasing
number
of
health
problems
.

If
a
child
is
not
taught
to
act
the
right
way
he
or
she
will
not
understand
what
the
reasons
of
punishment
or
angry
are
.

Although
I
think
that
the
American
and
British
cinema
are
the
best
,
I
am
sure
that
local
industries
can
show
something
significant
and
people
will
like
these
films
.

Two
years
is
more
than
enough
to
do
your
best
and
change
the
life
priorities
.

In
this
case
people
would
get
time
to
pay
for
produc
and
after
some
time
try
it
free
in
the
internet
,
because
internet
is
not
belong
to
anyone
.

Their
main
argumet
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
grown
in
a
not
really
good
famillies
becomed
great
persons
.

Copying
and
sharing
music
or
films
is
not
a
crime
o
theft
,
people
who
download
these
files
should
not
be
punished
.

\"
Agriculture
\"
in
Indonesia
is
in
the
middle
place
and
the
last
one
is
under
\"
industry
\"
control
.

And
they
need
to
find
a
solution
to
the
problem
.

Study
there
decreased
in
visits
in
8
%
from
10
%
to
2
%
between
1990
and
2000
.

In
the
modern
world
there
are
lists
of
certain
drugs
that
are
forbidden
for
professional
athletes
.

The
most
dramatic
was
the
change
for
technology
-
we
can
see
that
jobs
in
this
sphere
are
much
more
popular
now
.

For
others
goals
both
transportation
ways
are
equally
useful
.

Nowadays
more
and
more
people
need
glasses
and
the
cause
is
not
a
biological
factors
.

Undoubtedly
,
when
there
is
an
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
in
every
subject
,
it
gives
people
a
chance
to
improve
their
manners
and
socializing
skills
.

Some
philosophers
say
that
happiness
is
freedom
from
suffering
but
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
it
means
following
your
way
,
feeling
confident
,
safe
and
comfortable
and
not
wasting
your
life
.

Some
people
think
that
the
best
way
for
improving
health
of
society
is
by
increasing
the
number
of
sport
facilities
that
will
give
opportunities
to
us
to
improve
health
.

I
think
there
is
a
problem
number
one
.

Also
,
the
metals
is
most
popular
goods
by
rail
,
but
the
goods
which
mast
poplar
by
road
is
food
products
.

In
the
table
there
are
5
world
regions
which
were
used
for
measuring
of
unemployment
.

And
sometimes
people
should
found
allternative
decisions
.

Nowadays
a
huge
amount
of
scientific
research
are
sponsored
by
the
private
organisations
rather
than
by
governments
.

Music
and
films
are
not
for
free
:
musicians
and
film
producers
have
made
them
for
money
and
they
put
huge
amounts
of
time
and
strengh
into
implementation
their
ideas
.

I
believe
that
people
have
to
be
critical
about
information
they
receive
,
and
have
a
healthy
level
of
critisism
.

Secondly
,
I
think
,
it
is
really
essential
to
accept
more
female
students
in
such
areas
where
men
are
exceeded
.

What
is
more
,
projections
for
2050
demonstrate
that
the
number
of
children
to
14
years
old
in
Yemen
is
three
times
bigger
than
in
Italy
in
per
cents
.

Today
more
and
more
young
people
commit
crimes
.

It
is
clearly
seen
from
the
circle
graph
that
the
number
of
people
aged
15
-
59
years
lived
in
Italy
in
2000
prevaliges
the
number
of
people
in
Yemen
(
61,6
%
and
46,3
%
)
.

The
second
measure
is
social
advertisement
.

Such
problems
can
lead
to
mental
desieses
.

On
top
of
that
the
internet
community
called
'
LinkedIn
'
goes
as
the
second
popular
source
among
this
age
group
,
while
the
'
instagram
'
is
used
by
only
6
%
of
the
all
the
amateurs
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
some
reasones
to
download
music
of
movies
from
the
unofficial
store
.

They
know
that
they
can
not
be
punished
.

For
Artists
important
freedom
for
arts
,
and
I
think
that
they
can
to
have
it
.

In
this
country
is
predicted
significant
increase
in
number
of
elderly
people
on
18
percent
,
whereas
the
number
of
young
people
will
remain
more
or
less
stable
.

The
given
pictures
demonstrates
the
difference
of
ages
in
2000
and
2050
.

In
particular
,
the
difference
between
they
made
up
2
-
3
%
in
1940
and
2040
.

For
many
people
it
is
more
interesting
to
pay
computer
games
or
watch
TV
,
for
instance
,
than
do
any
sport
.

Considering
the
first
diagram
approximately
a
half
of
population
in
Yemen
in
2000
were
children
and
teenagers
.

In
Sweden
the
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
increased
gradually
throughout
the
period
1940
-
2014
and
could
continue
to
rise
,
reaching
26
%
in
the
year
2014
.

Overall
,
it
is
a
general
trend
that
the
transporting
of
manufactured
goods
has
one
of
the
highest
persentage
in
both
cases
.

There
is
no
doubt
that
we
live
in
a
very
complex
times
.

Today
it
offers
its
users
an
unlimmited
access
to
enormous
amount
of
different
data
which
should
be
filtered
sometimes
.

It
is
true
that
wedespread
use
of
technology
in
modern
wourld
can
cause
many
health
problems
.

The
building
of
planes
does
n't
solve
the
most
important
problem
of
the
Earth
which
threatens
our
existense
.

The
main
tendency
is
that
there
are
some
kinds
of
post
-
school
qualification
,
which
are
extremely
popular
between
each
gender
.

The
chart
show
amount
of
unemployment
people
from
2014
to
2015
in
N.
Africa
,
Middle
East
,
EU
,
L.
America
,
S.
Asian
and
worldwide
,
in
the
whole
.

It
is
very
important
for
parents
or
teachers
,
child
phycologists
to
make
sure
that
one
do
not
you
for
a
wrong
road
.

The
pie
chart
also
shows
that
amount
of
raw
industrial
goods
,
which
are
chemicals
,
metals
and
non
-
metallic
minerals
makes
30
percent
,
as
it
is
for
food
products
.

Furthermore
,
diminished
food
export
ruins
economy
of
agricultural
countries
as
their
only
income
comes
from
food
supplying
.

However
while
in
Germany
it
started
to
grow
back
in
1990
in
all
the
other
countries
in
continue
to
decrease
.

On
the
second
place
were
Germany
with
6
billion
dollars
'
print
book
market
.

We
see
one
of
the
closest
relation
in
economics
,
friendship
between
unemployment
and
crime
rate
.

Mostly
developed
countries
have
a
very
intensive
import
and
export
.

Conroversy
,
is
that
the
temperature
fell
slowly
in
Brazil
till
July
,
but
in
the
same
time
in
Russia
can
be
observed
that
is
rised
significantly
(
around
the
30
°
C
in
Russia
and
25
°
C
in
Brazil
)
.

The
idea
of
making
university
equal
-
for
boys
and
girls
?

There
are
two
age
categouries
of
people
who
have
not
huge
differnce
in
percentage
who
use
Linked
In
in
the
USA
.

First
of
all
,
everything
on
the
Earth
has
its
purpose
,
any
building
is
not
an
exeption
.

I
think
that
the
main
way
to
do
this
is
to
teach
youngsters
to
be
more
responsible
.

Projections
for
2050
shows
that
people
who
15
-
59
years
increase
and
will
be
57,3
%
and
teenagers
are
less
.

The
less
stable
regions
was
Middle
East
in
which
the
unemployment
rate
decreased
on
1,4
percent
and
Latin
America
where
situation
with
unemployment
in
2015
was
better
than
in
2014
.

It
is
a
difficult
question
and
maybe
sometimes
official
control
is
relevant
.

One
of
that
is
be
sure
that
it
will
give
you
this
fealings
.

In
spite
of
it
,
architects
should
think
about
a
practice
of
building
,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
another
wonderful
buildings
nowadays
,
they
should
pay
attention
to
its
purposes
.

But
we
should
use
this
products
in
our
meal
because
it
give
us
usedful
vitamins
and
minerals
.

Relatives
surround
children
every
day
and
interact
with
them
.

Governments
can
help
with
this
by
financing
researches
.

The
pie
charts
illustrate
the
proportions
of
goods
transported
by
road
and
rail
between
Eastern
European
countries
in
2008
.

But
there
are
another
ones
,
that
do
n't
control
Internet
sphere
and
it
is
become
mostly
pirate
(
Eeat
Europe
)
.

On
the
one
hand
,
if
you
first
buy
and
you
are
able
to
listen
or
to
watch
,
you
can
not
say
beforehand
that
you
will
like
it
.

This
development
had
a
small
influence
on
a
country
,
as
we
can
see
from
the
graph
.

Moreover
,
having
more
money
and
less
time
available
for
activities
unrelated
to
work
means
choosing
such
activities
more
carefully
.

The
second
problem
is
the
lack
of
discipline
at
school
.

People
use
spray
paint
and
drow
something
on
the
walls
of
building
and
of
fences
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
person
who
was
caught
by
using
steroids
must
be
banned
at
least
for
5
years
.

One
of
the
most
agreed
-
upon
possible
solutions
to
this
problem
comes
from
space
travel
and
space
colonization
.

The
table
which
is
given
at
the
task
describes
underground
railway
characteristics
in
six
different
cities
.

As
it
can
be
seen
in
the
graph
,
the
highest
difference
of
earnings
is
in
Japan
,
and
the
biggest
percentage
in
comparison
with
other
countries
is
kept
throughout
the
whole
period
.

For
example
,
a
female
student
will
not
be
permitted
to
study
one
subject
,
because
a
small
number
of
male
students
participates
in
it
.

It
is
really
hard
for
them
to
specify
what
they
need
,
to
choose
a
university
and
specialisation
which
will
direct
their
route
in
life
.

The
reason
why
young
people
start
commiting
crimes
is
the
absence
of
understanding
the
consecuenses
of
their
behavior
.

Considering
the
group
of
the
age
of
40
and
above
,
their
preferences
lead
to
Arts
cources
(
45
per
cent
)
,
even
the
number
of
these
students
is
over
than
those
who
chose
learning
science
and
doing
sport
all
.

So
if
large
companies
stop
working
,
dozens
o
humans
will
be
without
really
wonderful
,
fasionable
and
well
-
maked
products
.

Moreover
,
the
dramatic
rise
is
predicted
by
the
2030
's
.

When
people
are
over
49
,
the
level
of
studying
for
career
is
almost
15
percent
,
and
the
one
for
interest
is
already
70
percent
.

It
is
very
important
for
the
forming
of
the
children
's
own
vocabulary
.

In
all
age
groups
except
the
one
of
people
from
55
to
64
years
,
men
spent
more
time
doing
exercise
than
women
.

These
ways
will
help
to
reduce
most
of
the
problems
caused
by
electronic
machines
.

However
,
I
do
not
agree
with
the
point
of
view
that
people
copying
and
sharing
\"
art
products
\"
should
be
punished
.

Secondly
,
how
people
want
to
develop
health
way
of
living
without
providing
sports
facilities
and
equipments
?

But
in
Italy
there
is
an
alternative
picture
.

Nowadays
it
is
wide
spread
practice
around
the
world
when
the
person
has
equal
rights
to
enter
the
university
inspite
of
his
age
,
sex
or
income
.

Talking
anout
Instagram
,
a
large
proportion
of
its
followers
are
young
people
(
18
-
29
years
old
)
while
a
small
percentage
of
its
users
are
elderly
people
(
50
-
64
and
65+years
old
)
.

If
we
remember
the
greatest
researchers
,
scientist
,
writers
,
politicians
,
we
will
see
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
change
the
world
or
the
country
as
they
want
because
they
can
understant
more
in
comparison
to
common
people
.

As
for
the
future
,
only
two
countries
tend
to
retain
printed
book
versions
.

Overall
,
the
highest
point
of
all
tables
is
88
percent
of
female
workers
in
the
services
in
Australia
and
the
smallest
point
of
all
tables
is
1
percent
of
female
workers
in
the
agriculture
in
Australia
.

Nevertheless
,
some
people
think
that
the
way
to
happy
life
is
only
money
and
expensive
leasure
time
.

In
some
subjects
there
are
no
them
at
all
,
just
because
they
decided
not
to
choose
it
.

Some
people
think
that
people
who
are
engaged
in
illegal
copying
,
sharing
and
downloading
music
or
films
should
be
punished
.

Others
do
not
think
so
,
and
they
prefer
to
earn
money
instead
of
leisure
time
.

So
we
all
have
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
share
with
friends
all
information
we
like
.

Furthermore
,
in
all
countries
the
percentage
difference
in
1995
is
substantially
smaller
than
in
1985
.

According
to
the
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
people
of
both
sexes
can
have
equal
rights
to
receive
an
education
in
any
areas
.

The
worldwide
's
unemployment
rate
is
between
these
figures
and
also
did
not
change
(
5,9
%
)
.

The
pie
chart
,
related
with
transporting
by
road
,
demonstrates
that
the
most
significant
proportion
is
food
products
that
is
about
30
%
of
total
quantity
of
goods
.

The
main
thing
that
is
seen
from
the
chart
is
gradually
fall
of
eBook
market
and
increasing
of
print
book
market
in
all
four
countries
in
period
from
2014
to
2018
.

For
the
majority
of
people
it
's
their
goal
to
feel
even
once
happy
and
have
an
apportunity
to
say
it
proudly
.

And
in
projection
to
2050
the
amount
of
old
people
will
grow
,
and
the
middle
-
aged
group
will
become
smaller
by
15
percent
.

In
last
30
years
it
increases
to
about
18
%
in
2020
and
in
2040
the
population
aged
65
and
over
is
about
25
%
.

However
,
I
presume
that
family
is
the
most
powerful
institute
of
our
social
life
,
that
havs
a
huge
impact
on
any
child
's
life
.

There
was
also
a
new
library
function
in
2000
.

Nevertheless
,
a
child
,
who
enters
the
primary
school
,
has
no
idea
about
the
number
of
subjects
he
will
have
to
study
.

The
smallest
number
o
transportations
were
made
by
non
-
metallic
minerals
.

The
illustrations
compare
the
proportion
of
the
production
which
is
moved
between
areas
of
Eastern
Europe
in
the
year
2008
.

Some
people
claim
that
punishment
is
the
best
way
to
control
the
number
of
crimes
.

Today
universities
are
full
of
young
women
and
men
.

Consequently
,
person
can
not
recognize
the
type
of
these
copies
and
download
them
.

In
the
period
between
1979
and
1984
,
visits
abroad
by
UK
residents
increase
of
8
millions
,
and
visits
to
the
UK
by
overseas
residents
grow
of
3
millions
.

They
do
n't
need
to
walk
and
take
some
book
in
the
library
,
because
of
they
can
just
click
to
Internet
and
download
this
book
.

Before
that
,
really
low
positions
of
Japan
could
be
caused
by
the
Nuclear
explosions
in
Hirosima
and
Nagosaki
,
and
after
-
explosion
results
:
as
mutations
and
cancer
.

For
example
,
people
who
make
new
friend
in
school
have
more
broaded
and
wide
thinking
,
because
they
are
constantly
share
with
thir
friends
new
ideas
and
other
things
for
discussion
,
which
they
do
not
want
to
discuss
with
their
family
.

I
think
that
all
people
must
to
have
possible
to
show
their
talantes
,
or
show
to
other
people
their
imagine
in
their
realised
ideas
.

The
amount
of
crimes
increase
every
year
.

I
think
that
there
are
some
effective
measures
which
can
help
to
avoid
these
unplesant
situations
.

As
we
can
see
for
2050
this
population
of
0
-
14
years
will
fall
to
37
%
.

To
conclude
,
this
essay
shows
that
one
of
the
main
solutions
to
reduce
the
among
of
health
problems
caused
by
technologies
is
being
more
active
and
spending
more
time
outdoors
.

For
example
,
the
quantity
of
people
over
60
years
old
will
raise
to
42,3
%
by
2050
year
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
from
the
graph
,
that
Facebook
enjoys
the
greatest
popularity
among
American
adults
irrespective
of
their
age
.

The
charts
compare
the
amount
of
goods
that
was
transported
by
rail
and
by
road
.

Some
food
and
drinks
are
break
out
stomache
.

These
processes
can
lead
to
serious
problems
with
health
and
to
individual
chronical
ilnesses
.

In
the
modern
life
,
where
the
knowledge
of
people
is
the
most
important
thing
,
that
provides
opportunities
to
choose
a
well
-
paid
and
interesting
job
,
such
thing
as
university
but
a
great
impact
.

The
second
noticeable
trend
was
that
the
percentage
of
metals
transportation
by
rail
(
35
%
)
was
considerably
higher
than
the
proportion
of
delivering
metals
by
road
(
11
%
)
.

In
this
country
eBook
market
as
5
time
smaller
with
a
1
billion
dollars
.

Now
(
and
in
our
history
also
)
it
is
a
very
big
problem
to
governemt
and
cityzens
.

In
1990
a
tenth
of
visitors
used
livbraries
for
studying
,
while
in
2000
this
number
decreased
5
times
.

There
are
no
strict
and
exactly
answer
what
it
is
but
everybody
try
to
find
it
despite
a
lot
of
factors
that
make
it
difficult
to
do
.

Secondly
,
today
it
is
a
century
of
global
economics
,
all
countries
around
the
world
communicate
and
trade
.

They
are
tallents
of
their
products
.

They
work
hard
in
order
to
reach
such
success
.

Some
people
argue
that
farmeres
need
to
produce
the
food
only
to
their
counties
.

At
the
same
time
in
Italy
the
number
of
60
+
years
old
is
predicted
to
rise
practically
twice
and
amount
of
young
and
middle
-
aged
population
will
decrease
.

In
april
the
temperature
starts
to
go
down
from
27
°
C
to
25
°
C
(
in
March
)
.

The
Sweden
population
was
increasing
until
the
slight
fall
in
1980
,
after
which
it
began
to
flactuate
between
15
and
25
percents
.

It
is
30
percent
of
all
students
in
the
cours
.

The
last
reason
I
suggest
is
a
disrespect
for
law
.

During
these
ages
the
statistic
of
this
country
is
very
changable
.

For
intstance
,
in
the
USA
no
the
long
-
term
isolation
(
because
a
person
in
this
case
realizes
that
he
or
she
will
inevitably
leave
a
jail
in
the
future
)
but
the
highest
form
of
punishment
-
kill
-
motivate
people
not
to
commit
such
deeds
.

It
can
be
due
to
vary
reasons
.

Overall
,
it
can
be
seen
,
that
the
share
of
manufactured
goods
,
that
are
delivered
both
by
trains
and
by
trucks
,
is
practically
the
same
.

As
I
already
said
,
the
law
is
working
for
everyone
.

They
should
n't
know
the
person
but
should
know
the
punishment
he
or
she
got
.

Manufactured
goods
in
this
two
pie
charts
is
near
to
twenty
five
per
-
cents
of
all
pie
.

But
,
in
my
opinion
,
only
the
countries
with
stable
economic
situation
can
allow
and
have
to
allow
themselves
to
spend
big
money
on
such
researches
and
experiments
:
for
example
,
I
think
that
at
this
moment
Elon
Musk
is
one
of
the
most
important
people
for
the
humanity
because
of
his
space
projects
.

On
the
other
hand
,
many
of
artists
is
insane
so
if
government
gives
them
freedom
,
it
would
be
very
dangerous
for
our
mind
.

At
the
same
time
that
figure
will
fall
in
Italy
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

To
sum
up
,
the
main
thing
that
can
be
observed
that
during
the
time
people
changed
themselves
provesional
in
different
areas
and
in
the
2008
year
,
technology
sector
was
the
most
popular
.

Firstly
,
everyday
routine
requires
the
possibility
to
get
to
some
other
countries
and
even
continents
in
hours
.

However
,
the
economic
situation
has
not
always
been
so
brilliant
,
moreover
,
it
was
much
worse
there
then
in
Europe
and
America
,
so
the
number
was
relatively
low
until
the
expected
acute
rise
in
2030
.

Moreover
,
we
should
not
forget
the
historical
examples
.

Nowadays
the
question
of
influence
in
child
's
life
is
starting
to
be
more
and
more
significant
.

In
my
essay
I
am
going
to
think
of
reasons
and
possible
solutions
.

In
this
essay
we
try
to
consider
both
points
of
view
and
make
some
conclusions
.

It
consided
that
happiness
is
a
main
aim
of
our
life
.

There
is
an
abundant
number
of
it
that
has
been
made
during
the
last
decades
thanks
to
the
private
companies
.

Others
prefer
to
have
more
free
time
and
less
money
.

Instead
of
N.
Africa
,
S.
Asia
and
Worldwide
'
percents
are
also
not
changed
.

Only
then
the
humanity
can
reach
a
harmony
.

Amount
of
people
0
-
14
years
at
the
same
time
is
decreased
by
13,1
%
.

Only
Only
people
people
that
that
are
are
from
from
55
55
to
to
64
64
years
years
old
old
showed
showed
that
that
both
both
genders
genders
did
did
exercises
exercises
during
during
the
the
same
same
time
time
.
.

This
conclusions
can
be
proved
by
projections
for
2050
.

It
is
interesting
,
that
in
Brazil
January
is
one
of
the
warmest
mounths
in
the
year
.

We
leave
in
freedom
country
and
we
can
get
everithing
for
make
our
live
better
.

This
chart
describes
changes
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
selected
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

The
bar
chart
compares
the
numbers
of
popularity
between
males
and
fe
-
males
whose
chose
the
different
directions
in
their
profession
in
1999
in
Australia
.

So
,
there
are
more
males
in
these
universities
.

Equal
proporion
of
girls
and
boys
will
show
equal
right
of
all
genders
.

As
it
is
evidence
from
the
chart
there
were
two
types
goods
transported
:
by
rail
and
by
road
.

To
sum
up
,
I
would
line
to
emphasise
,
that
overall
percent
of
\"
old
\"
population
in
these
three
countries
increased
nearly
in
5
times
.

To
be
healthy
,
you
need
not
only
go
to
gum
,
you
should
change
your
mind
,
because
if
after
the
gum
you
will
eat
a
fustfood
,
the
effect
will
be
very
little
.

To
conclude
,
it
follows
as
a
logical
consequense
that
all
people
should
not
ignore
problems
of
others
because
we
all
live
on
the
Earth
and
in
one
society
.

Moreover
,
in
EU
the
unemployment
rate
gradually
rosed
in
2015
.

There
is
no
doubt
that
things
had
changed
in
the
last
few
decades
;
some
changes
are
betterment
and
some
changes
are
for
worse
.

Firstly
,
official
music
is
always
very
expensive
.

When
we
discuss
this
question
we
often
remember
for
example
about
sick
eyes
because
of
long
looking
at
screen
during
using
computers
,
TV
or
mobile
phones
,
or
about
dependence
our
brain
on
some
technologies
.

There
is
also
a
prediction
on
this
market
development
in
2018
.

As
can
be
seen
from
the
table
men
had
skilled
vocational
diploma
approximately
100
%
while
the
women
trend
undergraduate
diploma
near
70
%
.

There
are
two
ways
to
transport
goods
:
by
rail
and
by
road
.

There
are
many
examples
of
people
who
had
some
weakness
but
overcame
them
.

All
in
all
,
we
see
an
obvious
downwards
trend
in
every
country
except
New
Zealand
in
period
from
1990
to
1995
and
Japan
from
1980
to
1985
.

In
USA
the
amount
of
eldery
people
went
up
between
1940
and
1980
and
also
after
2030
and
reach
a
peak
at
28
procent
.

Enjoying
works
of
art
is
meant
to
be
one
of
the
most
effective
ways
to
reduce
stress
,
that
is
why
being
surrounded
by
beautiful
buildings
while
you
are
driving
home
or
just
walking
down
the
street
could
definitely
have
a
positive
impact
on
our
everyday
life
.

On
the
other
hand
,
some
ideas
of
tallant
people
con
be
useful
for
socity
.

Therefore
,
other
countries
who
have
more
power
and
influence
should
help
.

For
bachelor
's
degree
the
number
of
females
and
males
is
almost
the
same
and
it
reaches
approximately
50
per
cent
for
both
of
them
.

Some
of
them
keep
healthy
diet
and
eat
only
healthy
food
.

Moving
to
the
situation
in
the
UK
in
2015
,
it
can
be
said
that
the
percentage
of
non
-
white
population
there
was
immensely
lower
that
in
the
USA
.

Seconly
,
the
goverment
should
ban
cars
from
city
centre
.

So
how
am
I
supposed
to
use
these
discs
?

Nowadays
the
prevalent
number
of
scientific
research
is
sponsored
by
private
companies
rather
than
governments
.

It
was
approximately
59
million
in
2012
,
whereas
in
2013
there
were
around
100
million
users
who
accessed
Facebook
using
their
mobile
phones
.

From
the
point
of
about
26º
in
January
,
it
slightly
plummets
to
the
lowest
point
of
about
22º
in
July
and
recovers
again
to
25º
in
December
.

It
is
obvious
that
they
take
time
.

In
conclusion
,
it
should
be
said
that
there
is
a
tedency
that
there
live
crucially
less
non
-
white
people
,
that
white
ones
in
the
UK
and
only
a
small
amount
of
them
are
imprisoned
compairing
with
another
nationality
.

Every
generation
is
unique
and
it
may
be
that
the
laws
of
the
old
generation
just
do
n't
suit
the
philosophy
of
the
new
one
.

For
instance
,
the
problem
of
world
hunger
remains
unsolved
to
this
day
and
money
should
be
spent
on
the
people
who
starve
,
because
lives
of
millions
of
people
are
valuable
.

Moreover
,
if
people
do
not
care
about
beauty
of
buildings
it
is
easer
to
create
modern
,
practise
offices
and
houses
for
a
big
amount
of
people
.

Overall
,
we
can
see
that
the
biggest
percentage
of
unemployements
is
in
North
Africa
,
wile
the
least
one
is
in
South
Asia
.

The
issue
is
complicated
and
many
facts
have
to
be
considered
.

But
it
just
does
not
work
the
other
way
.

It
is
wrong
to
not
say
about
some
theories
about
other
harmful
modern
technologies
.

Money
can
give
you
power
,
costy
items
and
opportinities
to
live
in
luxurious
hotels
but
they
will
not
give
you
true
friends
and
self
-
confidence
.

It
better
way
that
not
damage
and
do
n't
uttruct
on
their
hands
or
mind
.

Middle
East
region
did
not
differ
from
N.
Africa
strongly
,
but
its
decreased
unemployment
rate
in
2015
was
considerably
lower
.

Furtermore
,
parenting
is
all
about
affecting
and
raising
the
child
from
your
own
point
of
view
.

So
,
many
people
think
that
these
films
are
more
vivid
and
stunning
.

Russian
government
give
financial
support
but
unfortunately
this
system
does
n't
work
well
yet
.

The
equal
amount
of
users
can
be
seen
in
the
group
of
18
-
29
and
more
than
65
the
percentage
of
which
sharply
decreases
in
comparison
to
other
groups
.

However
,
starting
from
visiting
school
childrens
'
socialisation
process
is
mostly
influenced
by
pupils
(
classmates
)
and
teachers
at
school
.

I
tend
to
disagree
with
the
previous
statement
.

Nevertheless
,
from
the
very
time
we
were
born
we
tend
to
show
some
specific
patterns
of
behaviour
which
remain
the
same
during
all
our
lives
.

Secondly
Secondly
,
,
if
if
there
there
is
is
less
less
import
import
,
,
there
there
will
will
be
be
less
less
competition
competition
for
for
domestic
domestic
companies
companies
.
.

We
can
not
help
but
notice
if
a
house
looks
aesthetically
appealing
or
not
.

The
biggest
underground
route
is
the
oldest
.

This
is
pretty
explicable
as
Instagram
is
a
relatively
new
network
.

Today
,
there
is
an
important
issue
of
independence
and
economy
of
country
;
so
there
are
people
,
who
think
that
counry
should
produce
food
for
its
own
people
and
try
to
make
import
less
.

It
is
obvious
that
transportation
of
manufactured
goods
is
nearly
the
same
by
both
of
these
means
,
12
%
of
machinery
is
transported
by
rail
,
and
only
2
%
by
road
.

Usually
the
economy
of
the
country
is
based
on
import
and
export
.

Moreover
,
we
can
notice
the
huge
distribution
of
lengh
of
route
.

The
charts
show
how
the
population
of
Italy
and
Yemen
differed
by
the
age
in
2000
and
some
predictions
of
the
change
by
2050
.

The
most
useful
network
by
every
group
is
Facebook
.

On
the
contary
,
the
roads
were
mostly
used
to
move
food
and
non
-
metallic
minerals
.

It
can
be
a
race
,
mind
capabilities
,
any
physical
characteristics
and
so
on
.

Some
people
think
that
the
government
should
control
their
behaviour
,
while
others
are
sure
that
artists
should
be
free
in
expressing
their
ideas
.

The
following
charts
represent
the
information
on
the
ages
of
the
populations
of
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
projections
for
2050
.

The
distances
are
28
and
11
respectivly
.

It
may
sound
silly
,
but
from
my
point
of
view
,
this
formula
of
happiness
can
not
be
widespread
by
its
nature
and
must
ti
be
confirmed
by
each
person
.

Moreover
,
private
companies
concentrate
on
the
people
's
attitude
towards
their
behaviour
in
social
life
,
that
is
why
it
is
a
great
sign
for
big
guns
to
show
their
maturence
and
provide
the
world
with
new
brilliant
researches
.

It
can
be
noticed
that
in
general
the
temperature
in
Brazil
is
more
equal
during
the
year
(
it
changes
from
+18
dg
to
+30
gd
)
and
in
Russia
there
is
a
big
gap
between
the
hottest
and
the
coldest
weather
:
from
-
40
dg
to
+25
dg
.

Simply
,
you
should
enjoy
every
day
of
living
,
certainly
,
there
can
be
some
terrible
events
and
happenings
,
but
they
should
not
spoil
your
good
mood
.

Manufactured
good
take
a
quite
similar
part
in
the
charts
-
it
is
near
a
quarter
of
all
goods
.

One
the
one
hand
,
it
is
a
sourse
of
unrespectable
behaviour
to
the
producers
of
the
films
and
compositions
because
they
had
to
work
hard
,
spend
lot
's
of
money
to
create
their
ideas
and
,
what
is
more
,
their
creations
contain
the
souls
of
their
makers
.

It
is
well
known
,
that
people
have
to
pay
for
music
and
films
in
some
contries
,
because
the
law
of
protecting
rights
is
there
,
and
almost
there
humans
always
want
to
punish
illegal
content
.

All
regions
have
diffrent
data
of
the
unemployment
rate
.

At
second
,
as
the
territory
of
Russia
is
really
large
,
there
are
a
lot
little
towns
where
people
can
not
get
neccessary
edition
so
they
just
download
pirate
copies
.

To
my
mind
,
the
beauty
in
our
life
is
one
of
those
things
which
could
help
us
to
do
this
.

There
are
a
lot
of
similar
things
(
clothes
/
shoes
)
in
big
famous
shops
which
are
worn
by
a
lot
of
people
everywhere
.

To
begin
with
,
I
would
say
that
the
main
characteristics
that
we
have
since
we
were
born
such
as
gender
,
race
or
nationality
without
doubt
have
a
great
influence
on
our
lifes
.

The
thing
is
we
live
in
the
epoch
of
extended
consumerism
,
thus
soon
there
will
be
not
enough
resources
for
everybody
in
a
planet
.

Whatis
the
reason
of
this
Fenomenon
?

However
,
the
difference
of
amounts
here
are
exactly
6
times
for
various
ways
of
transportation
.

This
means
that
there
will
be
twice
more
old
people
in
Italy
in
2050
than
it
was
in
2000
.

Some
people
think
that
serving
its
purpose
is
more
important
for
a
building
than
its
appearance
and
that
architects
,
those
job
is
to
make
buildings
beautiful
,
should
not
try
hard
to
do
so
.

To
conclude
,
there
are
a
lot
of
technologies
that
harm
people
's
health
,
but
this
problem
can
be
reduced
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
not
denying
fact
that
so
often
children
need
to
spend
their
time
indoors
.

The
desperation
borne
out
of
the
fierce
competition
between
companies
and
the
race
for
quicker
positive
results
might
force
the
companies
to
refuse
to
disclose
full
information
and
even
rig
the
results
.

However
,
it
is
thought
that
air
travels
are
more
harmful
due
to
huge
sizes
of
engines
of
air
transport
.

The
oldest
people
took
about
one
forth
.

On
the
charts
below
,
we
can
see
the
information
about
the
ages
of
the
populations
of
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
projections
for
2050
.

Firstly
,
it
I
significant
to
emphasize
,
that
the
least
ammount
of
people
aged
65
and
over
was
in
Japan
in
1940
.

The
third
argument
is
ability
to
get
harmful
software
while
pirate
files
download
.

This
way
helps
to
increase
amounts
or
creators
monty
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
quiet
radical
because
there
is
no
necessity
to
punish
people
.

On
the
one
hand
,
there
should
not
be
any
special
rules
and
laws
for
web
-
crime
.

To
sum
up
,
both
the
number
of
visits
by
people
from
the
UK
and
abroad
went
up
and
the
most
common
countries
which
UK
residents
prefer
to
go
to
is
located
in
Europe
.

On
the
one
hand
,
the
increase
of
the
amount
of
sports
facilities
can
bring
some
improvement
to
people
's
health
.

It
suddenly
reaches
the
peak
of
25
percent
and
continues
to
rise
futher
.

Many
of
experiements
represented
incredible
results
,
where
participants
were
divised
in
two
groups
:
using
and
not
using
mobile
phones
for
two
months
.

It
should
be
mentioned
,
that
I
suppose
that
the
characteristic
of
every
person
is
very
important
,
but
experiece
are
the
most
important
.

In
my
opinion
both
methods
have
their
problems
such
as
riscs
of
mistakes
of
the
first
way
and
difficulty
of
the
second
.

Futhermore
,
it
is
significant
that
today
people
have
more
problem
s
with
their
eyes
and
with
other
important
organs
because
they
always
site
near
the
different
computers
or
radiote
instrument
and
do
not
do
any
physical
exercises
to
improve
their
abilities
.

In
conclusion
it
should
be
said
that
you
can
make
your
life
happy
,
you
can
live
in
happiness
.

Although
the
market
is
almost
two
times
lower
than
the
one
of
printed
books
,
it
still
equals
5,5
billion
dollars
,
which
is
bigger
than
any
other
markets
of
electronic
books
on
the
graph
.

There
is
significant
differance
with
other
three
regions
in
indicators
It
's
clear
that
in
Middle
East
and
Latin
America
the
unemployment
rate
had
fallen
in
2015
.

As
for
Japan
,
the
trend
stays
constant
for
about
20
years
,
then
rises
a
little
and
goes
up
incredibly
up
to
23
%
of
the
population
aged
65
and
over
in
2040
.

The
main
reason
for
that
is
big
amount
of
time
which
people
have
to
spend
in
front
of
monitors
during
they
typical
day
working
in
office
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
modern
technologies
can
make
people
's
life
more
safe
than
it
was
before
.

Some
people
think
that
it
is
better
to
them
,
because
now
they
can
buy
products
that
are
popular
in
more
developed
countries
with
same
quality
and
prise
,
but
some
peolpe
claim
that
this
process
kills
the
industry
of
other
countries
,
because
the
folks
have
no
place
to
work
and
they
just
become
unemployed
.

To
conclude
,
I
strongly
disagree
with
them
.

I
totally
disagree
with
this
point
of
view
because
there
is
an
improvement
of
law
system
and
the
system
of
market
's
control
and
the
amount
of
pirate
copies
decreases
.

Another
group
of
people
says
that
sport
activities
do
not
mean
as
much
for
our
health
as
other
measures
.

In
two
last
groups
,
people
with
Postgraduate
diploma
and
Master
's
degree
,
the
differences
between
the
males
and
females
made
up
40
%
and
20
%
respectively
,
over
the
given
period
.

To
add
,
15
-
59
years
people
,
their
amount
will
decrease
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

73
%
of
them
prefer
facebook
,
25
%
use
Instagram
and
31
%
goes
to
Linked
In
.

Some
people
are
sure
that
buildings
should
look
beautiful
.

To
sum
up
,
there
were
some
changes
connected
with
unemployment
in
several
regions
from
2014
until
2015
.

The
amount
of
people
attending
Arts
courses
is
smaller
,
than
the
amount
of
Science
courses
and
it
has
600
students
.

According
to
the
second
chart
the
most
popular
country
visited
by
UK
residents
at
this
period
of
time
was
France
,
which
was
visited
by
about
11
millions
of
people
of
people
that
accounts
for
a
large
percent
of
the
whole
UK
people
going
abroad
.

But
the
values
grows
up
to
December
,
where
they
are
similar
to
January
.

Second
,
it
was
predicted
that
a
quantity
of
children
from
0
to
14
will
reduce
by
2050
in
these
two
countries
.

Some
countries
in
order
to
diminish
some
serious
civil
issues
are
considering
the
program
which
aim
is
to
provide
citizens
a
minimal
amount
of
money
.

Moreover
,
as
children
grow
up
they
start
close
relationship
and
make
friend
with
others
.

There
is
a
belief
that
the
each
faculty
and
discipline
should
be
applied
by
the
same
number
of
girls
and
boys
.

In
conclusion
I
would
like
to
emphasize
that
universities
will
not
solve
gender
problem
by
accepting
the
same
number
male
or
female
because
it
should
be
a
student
's
choice
and
problem
of
government
.

Metals
transportation
by
road
constitutes
for
11
%
and
almost
3
times
more
(
35
%
)
for
by
rail
transportation
.

Only
I
can
decide
what
to
do
in
my
life
,
in
what
way
to
solve
my
problems
.

But
it
is
clearly
seen
that
in
projection
there
is
less
amount
of
people
15
-
59
years
old
than
in
2000
.

More
then
a
half
of
transportations
by
road
consists
from
food
products
and
manufactured
goods
(
58
%
)
.

In
Sweden
was
a
dramatical
increase
of
population
from
13
%
to
25
%
during
the
period
of
4
-
decades
,
exept
the
short
period
of
time
in
2015
-
2030
years
.

Dramatic
changes
are
depicted
in
figure
of
Sweden
,
whichreached
all
-
time
high
at
80
%
in
1970
and
plummeted
after
that
to
calculation
of
45
%
in
1985
.

On
the
one
hand
,
it
is
normal
that
in
our
modern
society
people
want
to
improve
themselves
,
it
takes
a
lot
of
time
,
it
a
hard
work
.

The
percentage
of
people
aged
65
and
older
is
just
a
bit
lower
at
the
beginning
:
it
is
5
%
of
them
in
the
country
.

Relationships
in
a
field
of
science
can
appear
to
be
one
of
the
reasons
for
countries
to
help
each
other
,
especially
when
the
states
colloborate
to
study
medicine
.

For
example
,
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
in
sport
with
the
meldoniy
.

After
that
,
there
is
a
steady
growth
and
between
12
and
18
o'clock
it
remains
stable
at
40000
units
of
electricity
to
reach
then
a
peak
of
45
units
at
22
hours
.

In
contrast
,
the
amount
of
population
aged
65
and
over
in
USA
increased
from
about
9
%
in
1940
to
27
%
in
2040
.

Nowadays
the
production
of
food
is
the
burning
issue
on
the
global
level
.

Others
suppose
that
this
action
would
not
have
necessary
affect
and
money
should
be
spend
more
reasonably
.

In
conclusion
,
the
works
of
producers
and
musicians
should
be
protected
by
the
law
,
and
people
who
illegally
copy
and
further
propagate
the
works
should
be
punished
.

Even
though
financial
side
of
the
problem
might
be
the
key
to
prefer
useful
things
rather
than
beautiful
ones
,
the
architects
continue
creating
huge
pieces
of
art
that
are
basically
just
city
decorations
.

The
piracy
became
too
strong
tendency
and
too
techicaly
developed
to
be
stopped
that
easily
.

Also
musicians
and
film
producers
can
create
mote
copies
of
their
discs
,
for
example
,
and
try
to
solve
it
with
the
lowest
price
.

But
some
people
ordinary
and
also
some
artists
use
it
in
uncorrectable
ways
.

The
graph
clearly
shows
that
Facebook
is
the
most
popular
network
among
people
of
all
ages
.

That
is
why
people
who
steal
the
results
of
such
an
enourmous
work
should
be
punished
.

It
is
worth
noting
,
that
visitors
used
the
public
libraries
to
borrow
and
return
DVDs
only
in
2000
.

The
highest
level
of
unemployment
can
be
found
in
the
North
Africa
(
12,5
%
)
,
but
it
is
still
at
the
same
level
.

Some
of
them
becomes
good
and
popular
artist
,
because
people
like
their
works
,
but
not
ever
it
's
like
by
goverment
.

A
lot
of
people
use
mobile
phones
and
smartphone
everyday
and
everywhere
,
including
the
time
before
sleeping
.

Think
about
people
around
you
is
a
first
step
on
your
way
to
be
happy
.

But
on
the
other
hand
,
-
which
one
is
scary
me
more
-
how
in
our
real
life
universities
will
try
to
do
this
.

It
is
clearly
seen
from
the
charts
,
that
the
main
part
of
railway
transportation
is
metals
,
which
cinsist
35
%
of
all
goods
,
while
the
considerable
part
of
the
second
chart
is
given
to
food
products
(
30
%
)
.

Families
of
this
sort
sometimes
have
to
steal
for
living
.

The
only
good
thing
that
parents
and
teachers
can
do
,
is
to
cultivate
strong
will
in
then
and
try
to
teach
them
critical
thinking
,
so
they
would
understand
how
doing
\"
bad
\"
things
may
affect
the
society
and
the
country
they
are
living
in
.

This
problem
is
really
controversial
and
there
are
two
different
views
.

I
ca
n't
agree
with
this
statement
fooly
.

In
this
situation
parents
and
teachers
should
provide
psychological
help
and
assist
teenagers
in
choosing
their
path
.

Till
that
time
the
difference
was
growing
.

Using
this
as
the
main
reason
to
keep
mass
media
under
a
control
,
some
politicians
try
to
solve
their
own
problems
.

Furthermore
,
the
children
who
have
just
started
the
communication
with
new
people
,
create
their
own
habits
,
manners
and
types
of
behavior
.

It
is
possible
that
in
the
future
technologies
will
help
us
in
that
dilemma
with
the
judjement
of
other
human
beings
.

Overall
,
the
increas
of
the
electricity
consumption
was
indicated
for
keeping
warm
in
rooms
and
heating
water
in
both
seasons
.

There
are
many
situations
and
examples
when
coach
give
illigal
drugs
to
athletes
without
their
opinion
,
because
their
main
goal
is
victory
and
health
of
sportsman
on
the
second
plan
.

There
was
a
dramatic
increase
from
3
to
50
billion
minutes
of
mobile
calls
.

Many
people
believe
that
our
personal
characteristics
is
much
more
important
that
the
experience
,
because
different
types
of
experience
could
different
ways
affect
the
human
beings
consider
on
his
or
her
personal
qualities
.

Science
plays
a
paramount
role
in
our
today
's
world
.

But
,
it
's
obviously
that
characteristics
we
are
born
with
influence
more
on
our
persone
because
they
create
the
base
of
our
personality
and
development
.

The
youth
share
accounts
for
53
%
,
while
the
second
place
belongs
to
30
-
49
years
old
adults
with
only
25
%
.

All
in
all
,
I
think
no
one
should
be
strictly
punished
for
listening
to
a
song
or
watching
a
film
privately
even
from
a
downloaded
copy
.

Actually
,
it
is
an
old
tradition
of
distribution
songs
or
fairy
tales
from
one
person
to
another
,
from
one
speaker
to
another
.

It
is
argued
that
rising
number
of
human
diseases
is
caused
by
using
technologies
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
might
seem
selfish
to
not
take
care
of
neigbourhood
countires
.

And
once
I
met
this
person
occasionally
again
and
had
a
conversation
with
him
or
her
.

The
Unated
States
had
great
falling
of
difference
in
earning
(
it
decrease
in
about
a
half
)
,
whereas
the
UK
fell
only
in
10
per
cent
.

Some
people
probably
have
a
consideration
that
money
as
the
majoc
factor
that
provides
hapiness
.

Personally
,
it
is
crucial
to
enhance
crosscultural
interaction
and
apply
joint
forces
in
order
to
prevent
economic
crises
and
ecological
catastrophes
.

The
family
role
in
the
process
of
upbringing
is
widely
discussed
nowadays
.

And
it
causes
to
spending
time
just
sitting
.

Excpecially
this
statement
is
based
the
fact
that
number
of
young
people
ib
18
-
25
age
group
is
declined
from
112565
people
to
86430
people
and
it
was
similar
phenomen
for
all
age
groups
.

To
sum
up
,
although
these
pie
charts
have
similarities
,
there
are
several
differences
,
therefore
the
shares
of
each
transported
good
do
not
make
the
same
percentage
in
both
ways
of
transportation
.

This
is
followed
by
gradual
decline
to
the
lowest
point
of
30000
units
at
9
o'clock
.

That
are
the
key
question
.

In
my
point
of
view
,
I
am
sure
that
adults
need
to
help
youth
to
deal
with
their
problems
and
then
I
guess
the
youth
crimes
will
be
reduced
.

The
charts
show
that
the
tendencies
of
the
0
-
14
and
60
+
years
age
groups
are
alike
in
two
given
countries
.

They
choose
their
own
way
by
themselves
\"
.

Many
scientists
,
for
example
,
Mary
Skladovskay
-
Kury
,
were
woman
and
succeded
greatly
in
their
academic
work
and
made
some
important
inventions
.

On
the
other
side
of
the
coin
,
it
can
be
disagreed
with
the
statement
about
pursueing
downloading
people
.

It
is
also
an
exellent
opportunity
to
feel
independant
travelling
by
your
own
.

Nowadays
public
health
is
a
very
important
issue
for
most
countries
.

In
both
countries
number
of
young
people
will
go
down
by
2050
,
but
in
Yemen
decreas
in
young
population
is
bigger
than
in
Italy
.

The
graphs
show
the
process
of
ageng
population
in
both
countries
.

Since
1999
for
2002
the
level
of
percentage
of
rural
connection
to
the
web
raised
for
5
%
each
year
.

Teenagers
'
connection
with
sport
can
be
explained
by
having
subjects
like
PE
at
the
university
and
at
school
,
and
people
that
are
older
did
sport
by
themselves
,
so
they
spend
less
time
on
it
.

However
,
there
are
some
ways
to
minimaze
the
negative
effect
.

All
in
all
,
the
percentage
of
each
type
of
goods
is
different
in
respect
to
ways
of
transporting
.

Moreover
,
we
are
now
living
in
capitalism
society
and
the
idea
of
working
and
earning
might
seem
to
be
a
dominant
one
,
that
is
the
reason
for
forgetting
the
leisure
as
it
would
not
satisfy
a
modern
man
.

The
percent
of
manufactured
goods
transported
by
rail
and
road
was
approximately
similar
(
25
%
and
28
%
)
.

To
find
its
meaning
and
understand
their
wishes
,
a
lot
of
people
try
to
do
something
new
,
change
their
mind
and
lifestyle
or
even
fall
in
love
or
make
new
friends
.

Thirdly
,
teachers
in
schools
and
universities
should
tell
children
and
youngsters
about
the
damage
caused
by
long
-
time
use
of
gadgets
.

They
are
very
small
,
they
can
download
fils
and
not
to
think
about
consequances
.

It
all
attracts
watchers
from
the
whole
world
.

However
,
there
is
another
side
of
the
coin
.

On
the
another
hand
should
be
government
restrictions
on
what
they
do
,
in
whichever
way
artists
wish
.

What
is
more
,
if
theis
service
become
a
part
of
the
schools
,
this
communitys
will
be
advertised
by
schools
and
so
that
more
numbers
of
volonteeres
will
work
there
.

The
significance
of
the
safety
is
better
than
its
appearance
.

The
situation
in
Middle
East
is
just
a
little
better
than
in
North
Africa
.

If
we
look
to
the
graph
it
is
can
be
clearly
seen
that
the
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
was
higher
in
USA
than
in
other
countries
from
1940
to
1980
.

But
we
should
be
very
careful
for
choosing
sport
,
because
it
depends
on
your
health
.

For
example
,
people
lose
their
small
business
and
their
jobs
as
well
.

In
comparisson
with
trafic
problems
in
Moscow
this
situation
triggers
much
more
tragic
consecuences
.

That
's
where
friends
come
in
,
they
say
.

It
is
undisputable
that
every
single
child
has
their
own
\"
characteristics
\"
,
e.g.
the
level
of
health
,
the
immunity
to
deseases
,
the
power
of
muscles
.

However
,
due
to
economic
instability
people
lose
their
places
in
work
industry
and
they
have
to
ask
help
from
the
goverment
.

It
is
only
11
kilometers
long
.

London
railway
system
also
is
the
longest
with
394
kilometres
of
route
.

It
means
that
you
can
reach
happiness
only
with
spiritual
factors
as
love
and
mutual
belonginess
but
;
in
fact
,
we
know
it
is
not
enough
or
at
least
,
it
is
not
in
long
-
term
relationships
.

It
is
known
that
nowadays
the
young
people
commit
the
biggest
amount
of
crimes
compare
to
the
previous
times
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
such
situations
are
unacceptable
.

Moreover
,
they
do
not
depend
on
money
and
their
future
plans
,
they
orginize
their
time
in
the
way
to
have
more
free
hours
for
their
hobbies
.

To
solve
this
problem
teachers
and
parents
should
try
to
teach
young
people
some
empathy
that
depeciated
in
electronic
era
.

For
comparison
,
the
average
maximum
in
these
months
in
Brazil
is
30
°
C
.

What
is
meant
is
that
there
is
a
kind
of
a
tendency
that
men
prefer
mathematical
studies
such
as
engineering
,
computer
science
,
some
IT
-
branches
,
while
women
would
rather
choose
,
for
instance
,
social
science
like
sociology
or
politology
;
foreign
languages
and
literature
.

However
,
I
think
that
every
person
can
do
sports
without
any
special
equipment
.

All
in
all
,
despite
showing
some
amount
of
growth
the
eBook
market
is
far
from
overtaking
the
print
market
by
2018
globally
.

In
my
opinion
,
it
is
better
to
create
own
plantations
and
produce
own
food
.

First
of
all
,
modern
technologies
are
cause
of
problems
with
the
obesity
because
people
move
not
much
as
earlier
.

As
an
overview
,
the
typical
daily
demand
for
electricity
in
winter
is
the
leader
of
the
graph
.

The
main
rule
of
such
sportsmen
is
:
\"
the
aim
is
always
worth
of
any
sources
\"
,
and
the
solution
of
a
problem
of
how
such
athletes
should
be
punished
lies
in
them
being
banned
for
the
all
time
and
left
the
sport
.

So
,
film
industries
,
which
have
a
good
financial
support
have
a
chance
to
help
us
to
solve
our
problems
,
whereas
local
film
industries
can
not
.

This
essay
discusses
both
sides
of
the
question
,
and
offers
one
of
existing
solutions
.

To
conclude
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
it
is
more
important
to
construct
buldings
by
tacking
into
account
their
special
purpouse
,
because
it
is
much
better
to
built
strong
constructions
than
beautiful
ones
.

When
a
child
begins
to
attend
school
or
takes
part
in
some
courses
,
the
people
that
he
or
she
sees
and
hears
affect
a
child
in
the
way
he
or
she
thinks
and
behaves
.

In
conclusion
,
unpaid
community
service
have
some
pluses
and
some
minuses
.

To
sum
this
up
,
I
would
like
to
state
that
I
consider
laws
reducing
some
kinds
of
air
transportation
too
radical
.

Nearly
half
of
all
human
being
are
now
have
to
wear
glasses
,
because
they
have
to
look
at
the
monitors
for
a
long
time
of
their
jobs
,
besides
monitors
are
everywhere
in
the
streets
.

The
most
common
feature
of
this
chart
is
the
growing
of
a
e
-
Book
part
of
market
in
all
countries
from
2014
to
2018
.

Firstly
,
a
lot
of
people
just
do
not
have
so
much
money
to
pay
for
every
disc
with
new
song
or
film
and
the
only
solution
for
them
is
to
download
pirate
copies
.

Because
making
a
work
of
such
high
quality
demands
one
to
be
experienced
.

The
least
visited
country
is
Turkey
which
was
visited
by
2
million
British
residents
and
two
most
visited
places
are
Spain
(
9
million
)
and
France
(
11
million
)
.

In
conclusion
,
I
think
that
preparing
the
children
about
foreign
language
skill
as
soon
as
possible
is
a
good
decision
,
but
we
have
to
look
are
children
ready
or
not
for
it
.

The
most
rapid
growth
is
noticed
in
eastern
countries
,
such
as
India
and
China
.

This
fact
could
be
caused
by
the
situation
of
getting
married
or
pregnant
for
women
when
they
had
to
give
up
their
education
.

South
Asia
provides
us
with
the
smallest
numbers
.

Finally
,
there
are
a
number
of
relevant
examples
when
a
person
gets
to
an
unwanted
environment
,
but
remains
self
-
confident
and
does
not
take
up
the
wrong
way
.

Great
illustration
of
such
policy
is
culture
of
China
in
time
while
Mao
Zedong
was
reigning
.

People
who
claim
so
stress
that
it
is
not
nesessary
to
think
about
beauty
making
the
building
.

Moreover
,
the
results
of
regular
workouts
motivate
people
not
to
stop
,
once
they
started
.

To
sum
up
,
the
proportions
of
metals
and
food
products
transportation
were
nearly
the
same
35
%
and
30
%
in
different
charts
and
had
the
first
position
in
different
charts
.
and
the
percents
of
other
goods
in
different
ways
of
transportation
were
different
,
besides
manufactured
goods
.

The
most
popular
reason
,
sharing
photos
and
videos
,
was
more
important
to
female
audience
than
to
men
audience
,
as
well
as
other
reasons
,
such
as
seeing
funny
posts
and
learning
about
ways
to
help
each
other
.

We
can
see
that
the
lowest
temperature
is
acheived
in
January
(
-
42
)
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
some
disadvantages
in
favour
of
staying
in
a
home
town
.

The
projections
show
that
the
situation
will
have
serious
changes
in
the
future
.

Another
disadvantage
that
I
can
distinguish
is
that
because
of
this
tendency
small
local
bussinesses
are
prone
to
lose
their
culture
and
some
unique
features
.

The
striking
fact
of
appearing
of
a
new
category
of
visiting
reason
is
presented
by
the
second
pie
chart
.

Moreover
a
lot
of
people
who
ca
n't
pay
for
a
disc
with
music
or
a
ticket
to
the
cinema
free
internet
copies
become
a
great
opportunity
to
get
into
culture
and
to
be
in
trend
.

Moreover
,
underground
railway
systems
of
3
cities
have
the
biggest
amount
of
people
per
year
.

However
,
in
1970
its
result
was
rather
low
and
was
only
60
persent
.

The
government
that
is
not
buying
expensive
food
from
another
countries
can
spend
the
money
for
enhansing
the
level
of
people
's
life
or
improving
scientific
researches
.

As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
governments
should
actively
help
people
across
the
globe
since
it
is
a
genuinely
motivating
way
to
live
in
peace
and
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.

She
or
he
ca
n't
to
get
a
good
education
,
because
she
or
he
don
not
get
a
place
for
studying
.

Firstly
,
copying
and
sharing
pirate
copies
undermine
the
right
of
intellectual
ownership
.

First
of
all
,
it
ruins
the
limitalions
for
watching
or
listening
the
content
that
can
be
found
in
this
kind
of
Internet
sourses
.

The
maximum
temprature
have
a
frequency
from
July
to
August
(
increasing
of
2
degrees
)
and
it
is
an
increase
to
December
of
both
of
these
tempratures
.

Nowadays
pirate
copies
make
musicians
and
film
producers
lose
a
lot
of
money
.

In
case
of
his
government
should
protect
the
culture
of
the
city
.

According
to
the
data
,
the
major
group
in
sience
course
are
children
,
who
are
counted
for
more
then
300
people
.

Our
children
listen
to
music
in
internet
and
we
can
not
control
all
that
they
do
.

Besides
,
there
are
a
lot
of
children
who
can
not
imagine
their
life
without
computer
.

Government
should
care
about
people
.

A
similar
situation
is
to
be
observed
in
the
year
2005
,
when
87
%
of
males
were
active
in
comparison
to
only
77
%
among
the
females
.

If
we
will
speak
about
worldwide
unemployment
rate
,
we
should
notice
that
according
to
the
chart
it
also
did
not
change
.

In
my
opinion
,
I
agree
with
this
statement
.

In
In
my
my
opinion
opinion
,
,
creative
creative
people
people
have
have
very
very
big
big
influence
influence
on
on
local
local
population
population
,
,
local
local

culture
and
and
foreign
foreign

.
.

This
process
become
more
popular
and
fashion
at
the
time
.

What
about
Italy
,
the
charts
show
that
situation
is
different
to
Yemen
.

Males
are
naturally
more
talented
in
Physics
,
Math
and
physically
well
done
.

crime
rates
among
young
people
increased
and
now
they
are
higher
than
ever
before
.

Their
number
decreased
to
below
140
million
in
March
of
2013
.

In
conclusion
I
think
that
does
n't
matter
how
government
make
level
of
the
life
,
just
matter
which
is
this
level
.

Finally
,
modern
technology
like
wave
,
it
cn
help
help
modern
women
vaste
of
less
time
to
cook
dinner
,
for
example
.

However
,
teachers
have
certain
rules
.

Now
people
start
to
understand
that
we
all
live
on
the
one
planet
and
we
all
the
same
.

However
,
those
,
who
are
not
gifted
and
make
some
arts
for
money
also
should
be
glad
that
their
boring
arts
are
useful
for
someone
.

However
,
during
four
years
people
are
going
to
buy
more
eBooks
,
than
real
ones
,
but
printed
books
would
be
still
quite
popular
.

These
both
opinions
have
discused
for
many
times
.

Males
are
bigger
and
stronger
than
females
and
it
is
ridiculous
to
deny
it
.

However
,
the
more
we
set
special
conditions
the
bigger
problem
with
gender
stereotypes
is
.

LinkedIn
,
however
,
is
used
more
by
people
who
have
age
30
+
.

Firstly
,
the
purpose
of
the
building
is
more
important
as
people
should
be
in
safe
while
they
are
inside
the
building
which
was
created
by
the
architets
.

This
essay
states
some
examples
of
that
diseases
,
explains
the
reasons
of
their
appearance
and
give
recommendation
how
to
decrease
the
negative
influence
of
modern
technology
.

Turning
to
the
similarities
and
diffirences
between
the
charts
,
it
is
necessary
to
notice
that
,
as
it
is
obvious
from
the
pics
,
proportions
of
some
goods
are
fairly
equal
to
one
another
.

The
majority
of
adults
use
it
everyday
.

About
90
percent
of
males
had
the
skilled
vocational
diploma
and
only
10
percent
of
females
had
it
also
.

People
understand
it
and
they
will
new
sports
facilities
and
improve
their
health
,
because
of
sport
is
not
only
health
,
but
it
is
entatatiment
too
.

On
the
other
hand
musicians
and
film
producers
earn
a
lot
of
money
and
if
everyone
in
the
world
will
buy
their
music
or
film
,
including
that
they
would
can
buy
a
part
of
our
world/
In
conclusion
all
musicians
and
film
producers
should
make
their
products
'
prices
cheaper
if
they
want
to
decide
the
problem
with
illegal
pirate
copies
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
important
to
say
that
our
health
is
only
under
our
control
.

Still
,
the
private
research
'
findings
for
me
are
more
preferencial
.

But
he
wanted
to
know
more
than
3
languages
and
he
did
it
because
he
was
teaching
them
hard
during
2
years
.

The
first
table
presents
the
information
regarding
Indonesia
.

SO
other
countries
can
help
such
countries
and
it
's
people
to
survive
by
import
some
food
to
them
.

The
situation
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
is
completely
different
.

For
others
it
is
rather
more
important
to
educate
their
child
in
comfortable
schools
where
pupils
can
be
in
safety
or
to
take
care
of
their
health
in
hospitals
where
they
can
be
sure
that
nothing
bad
could
happen
if
any
member
of
their
families
would
have
to
go
there
for
some
time
.

It
also
notable
that
fraction
of
young
people
in
every
social
media
except
LinkedIn
is
the
highest
one
.

Technology
had
a
very
big
part
of
our
lives
and
it
happened
to
fast
.

Big
and
strong
contries
always
should
have
a
large
choice
of
food
.

And
that
31
boys
and
30
girls
wants
to
enter
on
this
subject
.

Its
rates
were
the
highest
in
2015
,
while
other
countries
decreased
gradually
.

The
males
were
leading
at
skilled
vocational
diploma
,
postgraduate
diploma
and
master
's
degree
,
while
females
were
better
at
undergraduate
diploma
and
bachelor
's
degree
.

The
more
essential
difference
is
shown
among
female
workers
in
both
areas
:
approximately
50
%
of
women
,
43
%
to
be
precise
,
work
in
the
agricultural
sector
,
while
therer
is
only
1
%
of
those
who
are
employed
in
there
in
Australia
.

Just
remember
that
it
is
your
life
and
it
is
your
choice
.

At
the
same
time
there
are
people
who
believes
some
external
factors
to
be
more
significant
for
a
child
's
development
and
growth
.

It
is
useless
to
deny
,
that
punishment
for
the
consumption
illegal
drugs
is
addicted
to
components
,
which
are
used
for
production
of
preparate
.

However
,
some
people
ca
n't
agree
with
this
.

First
of
all
,
women
should
be
given
the
same
chances
to
develop
their
academic
ability
as
the
men
do
,
because
of
the
fact
,
that
they
could
be
as
much
talanted
as
the
male
students
.

It
is
obvious
,
that
the
majority
of
goods
,
which
are
moved
by
rail
,
is
metals
.

All
in
all
,
the
problem
of
teenage
criminality
have
its
roots
in
the
indifference
of
adults
,
who
let
the
internet
to
be
the
best
and
the
only
friend
of
their
kids
.

The
chart
bellow
compares
the
different
levels
of
post
school
qualifications
in
terms
of
gender
in
Australia
in
1999
.

On
the
contrary
,
there
are
opinions
that
it
is
important
to
have
open
economy
and
cooperate
with
other
countries
in
terms
of
free
movement
of
goods
and
services
.

Furthermore
,
more
and
more
people
refuse
smoking
and
drinking
alcohol
because
of
its
sport
-
addiction
.

According
to
the
tables
,
the
biggest
proportion
of
employement
was
given
to
representatives
of
the
service
sector
in
two
countries
at
the
same
period
of
time
.

Firstly
,
this
hypothesis
was
accepted
by
constitution
and
that
do
it
right
.

Then
,
between
1985
and
1990
,
all
the
percentages
have
dropped
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
mention
,
that
my
opinion
is
not
professional
,
nevertheless
,
there
are
no
reasons
for
reducing
import
as
much
as
possible
.

For
example
,
government
also
maintain
the
sports
programmes
such
as
encouraging
of
Olimpic
winners
.

This
is
a
specialization
of
university
and
subject
.

Some
people
believe
that
governments
should
financially
support
local
movie
industries
.

Nevertheless
,
an
easy
access
to
sport
facilities
can
not
be
the
best
variant
in
improving
public
health
.

Secondly
,
I
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
countries
have
a
big
food
problems
,
such
as
countries
of
Africa
,
some
Asian
countries
or
some
countries
of
the
South
America
.

This
quastion
have
positive
and
negative
points
,
so
it
is
hard
to
say
that
this
idea
is
right
or
wrong
.

Moreover
,
sport
activities
provide
good
heath
and
as
a
result
people
do
not
have
to
spent
time
on
visiting
doctors
and
wasting
money
on
different
expensive
medicines
.

More
cooperation
will
allow
adults
to
chare
their
principles
with
the
young
and
help
them
to
avoid
adopting
abnormal
behavior
which
they
may
face
online
or
even
in
real
life
.

We
also
know
that
the
works
of
creative
artists
are
sometimes
rather
provocative
and
controvertial
.

This
aspect
was
not
present
in
1990
.

The
bar
charts
below
depict
the
background
of
different
ethnithities
of
both
the
ordinary
population
and
the
prison
one
in
2015
.

To
sum
up
,
I
believe
that
there
are
two
main
reasons
for
British
and
American
movies
being
so
popular
all
over
the
world
.

In
the
meantime
,
the
60
%
of
masters
in
Australia
are
men
.

It
amounts
seven
and
a
half
and
nearly
eight
(
7,9
)
in
2014
and
2015
respectively
.

Nowadays
people
try
to
develop
the
manufacturing
sphere
and
completely
forget
about
the
wastes
their
factories
produce
.

It
's
evident
that
the
gaps
between
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
in
the
towns
are
similar
for
the
whole
year
period
,
but
may
flactuate
from
5
to
10
degrees
.

Whether
the
universities
should
accept
equal
numbers
of
boys
and
girls
in
every
subject
is
a
question
worth
discussing
.

The
Instagram
often
users
are
teenagers
(
18
-
29
)
wheares
the
others
ages
use
instagramm
less
than
othe
sites
.

Firstly
,
society
where
man
is
situated
influence
his
personality
.

Secondly
,
watching
sports
can
improve
your
mood
.

In
contrast
,
food
products
take
about
30
%
in
road
transport
and
just
11
%
in
rail
one
.

They
say
that
sport
is
not
so
important
and
it
ca
n't
effect
the
public
health
,
but
this
is
not
truth
.

People
must
give
them
chance
to
make
a
new
interesting
and
good
quality
product
.

In
Middle
East
in
2014
the
percent
of
unemployment
rate
was
on
several
percent
higher
,
than
in
2015
.

The
number
of
these
problems
is
increasing
.

The
anothers
countiest
,
for
example
-
USA
,
terrible
behaviour
.

Therefore
,
the
decision
to
bond
the
life
with
it
implies
the
responsibility
,
one
might
make
an
inner
agreament
with
the
rules
of
this
society
.

I
assume
that
for
adults
with
children
this
option
is
preferable
.

The
second
reason
for
the
rise
of
the
juvenile
crime
is
the
exposure
of
the
young
to
the
violence
which
they
observe
on
a
daily
basis
while
watching
TV
or
playing
computer
games
.

The
hugest
difference
between
men
and
women
was
in
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

Trere
are
statistics
covering
the
period
of
time
from
1940
to
present
days
and
also
predictions
of
the
future
,
up
to
2040
year
.

And
what
is
also
interesting
it
is
that
the
gender
proportion
of
men
and
women
among
the
bachelors
is
most
the
same
,
but
there
were
a
little
more
graduated
females
than
males
.

However
,
the
warmest
climate
in
Brazil
is
noticed
in
winter
months
(
january
and
december
)
;
as
for
Russia
,
the
highest
temperature
is
shown
in
summer
(
july
)
.

And
other
regions
'
unemployment
rates
were
in
the
middle
values
.

Both
minimum
and
maximum
peaks
in
July
in
Russia
,
while
in
Brazil
there
is
a
slight
decrease
.

The
first
thing
that
can
be
done
to
improve
the
situation
is
educating
the
parents
about
basic
needs
of
their
children
,
such
as
food
,
health
care
,
clothes
,
appreciation
at
the
school
class
.

On
the
other
hand
,
in
Italy
this
group
is
prognosed
to
rise
until
42.3
%
while
middle
-
aged
population
is
supposed
to
fall
down
to
46.2
%
and
the
youngest
group
will
remain
almost
constant
.

The
second
reason
is
that
a
goverments
'
research
is
easier
to
check
and
to
prove
as
goverments
are
obliged
to
keep
all
of
the
information
and
data
.

For
example
,
if
speaking
about
music
-
people
want
to
listen
what
they
love
,
so
that
singers
make
a
records
for
sell
.

It
is
also
worth
pointing
out
that
the
number
of
this
age
group
fluctuated
throughout
the
whole
period
and
reached
a
peak
at
approximately
a
quarter
of
the
country
's
population
.

Thus
,
it
became
really
easy
to
do
illegal
things
with
less
chances
to
be
caught
.

Manufactured
goods
on
the
charts
stayed
the
same
,
but
manufactured
goods
transported
by
road
rised
slightly
on
3
%
.

The
oldest
of
the
routes
,
in
route
in
London
,
it
was
open
in
1863
,
but
the
newest
is
in
Los
Angeles
,
it
was
open
in
2001
.
if
we
talk
about
passengers
,
we
can
see
that
in
Tokyo
is
the
biggest
flood
of
the
passengers
,
the
second
place
takes
Paris
,
but
the
last
place
was
given
to
Kyoto
.

There
are
a
lot
of
thefts
who
copy
and
then
share
songs
and
films
in
the
Internet
.

From
the
chart
it
becomes
evident
that
younger
Americans
are
much
more
involved
in
social
network
than
their
aged
counterparts
.

If
someone
wants
to
be
famous
,
but
do
nothing
or
do
n't
have
any
talent
,
they
check
false
target
.

Maybe
Maybe
,
,
the
the
next
next
generation
generation
will
will
become
become
more
more
kind
kind
because
because
of
of
these
these
programmes
programmes
.
.

China
and
India
reached
the
highest
percentage
of
energy
from
foccil
fuels
,
however
,
China
's
number
began
to
fall
a
couple
of
years
ago
.

It
they
share
such
art
object
with
people
who
do
not
have
enough
mony
for
free
they
should
be
punished
in
a
not
strict
way
or
should
not
obtain
any
sanctions
at
all
.

These
days
,
many
people
are
convinced
that
happiness
is
the
main
life
goal
however
I
'm
not
sure
the
majority
of
people
are
happy
.

As
i
have
remainded
before
,
Internet
is
very
difficult
to
regulate
sphere
.

There
are
different
thoughts
about
building
and
art
like
about
things
which
could
not
be
without
each
other
nowadays
.

The
level
provide
clear
evidence
,
that
the
world
regions
have
very
different
amounts
of
unemployment
rate
in
2014
and
2015
.

Cities
are
placed
in
chronological
order
.

There
are
two
different
points
of
illegal
downloading
films
or
music
and
importance
of
punishment
for
them
.

Poor
families
quite
often
have
more
than
one
child
.

If
creators
lose
money
,
they
would
not
have
an
opportunity
to
pay
for
actors
and
other
people
,
who
were
involved
in
the
process
of
film
,
clip
or
song
making
.

Number
of
old
people
doubles
in
2050
and
amound
of
middle
age
people
decrease
on
one
third
.

Secondly
,
we
should
say
,
that
in
future
less
people
will
prefer
to
have
children
in
Yemen
and
Italy
.

Metals
friquntly
transported
by
rail
then
by
road
.

To
sum
up
,
information
about
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
is
different
in
the
different
countries
,
for
example
USA
,
Japan
and
Sweden
and
changed
year
to
year
.

So
,
a
prison
that
is
made
according
to
a
model
of
phsicologicaly
healthy
society
can
not
solely
punish
a
person
,
but
recreate
him
with
repaired
personality
.

My
point
of
view
,
that
any
person
can
make
out
of
itself
a
person
he
or
she
locents
.

Futhermore
,
apart
from
the
youngsters
,
people
aged
from
30
to
49
are
more
active
users
of
the
following
websites
than
respondents
from
the
last
two
age
groups
,
whereas
people
aged
65
+
are
the
least
active
users
of
all
the
ages
.

Deffinately
,
this
fact
can
explane
why
the
rate
of
violent
actions
increases
.

There
are
2
tables
presented
that
depict
the
percentage
of
male
and
female
employees
in
three
employment
sectors
in
2010
both
in
Indonesia
and
Australia
.

This
pronlem
is
becoming
more
and
more
serious
in
our
days
so
it
is
important
to
take
some
measures
to
solve
it
.

Any
restrictions
of
that
kind
provoke
problems
in
specialization
of
female
and
male
students
.

Secondly
,
alcohol
and
cigaretes
are
the
most
important
source
demaging
our
health
.

Then
there
is
a
group
of
regions
,
where
the
level
of
unemployed
people
is
lower
than
in
those
mentioned
regions
.

The
most
drammaticaly
rising
we
can
see
in
2030
where
the
line
significantly
goes
up
to
25
per
cent
from
10
where
it
was
.

Sometimes
it
can
lead
yougsters
to
take
after
their
weakly
educated
peers
a
even
criminals
which
ends
up
in
their
own
crime
involvement
.

While
traveling
what
is
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
the
sightseeing
?

However
,
the
subway
system
in
Los
Angeles
was
opened
only
in
2001
(
the
latest
one
)
,
it
has
longer
distance
than
in
Koyoto
,
where
number
of
kilometres
is
the
smallest
one
(
11
)
.

However
,
the
reasons
are
not
so
important
,
but
the
result
is
crucial
.

Nowdays
,
there
are
two
opinions
about
improvement
of
public
health
.

Secondly
,
people
's
desire
to
watch
some
film
often
depends
on
its
publicity
.

Many
people
are
agree
with
this
point
of
view
and
have
a
lot
of
reasons
for
it
.

In
1995
16
percent
of
both
girls
and
boys
were
overweight
.

Finally
,
all
people
are
affected
by
the
collective
symptom
,
that
makes
them
change
,
do
things
that
they
would
never
do
,
and
in
schools
this
phenomenon
often
happens
.

Nevertheless
,
some
columns
illustrate
anouther
trend
.

Machinery
were
not
popularity
in
Eastern
Europe
in
2008
.

And
therefore
many
children
did
n't
take
part
in
this
community
services
because
they
are
afraid
that
they
will
have
n't
enough
time
to
prepare
to
their
exams
.

Twice
higher
number
of
man
have
this
in
comparison
with
woman
.

The
chart
given
illustrates
the
situation
on
the
print
and
eBook
markets
of
different
countries
in
2014
and
offers
a
prediction
for
2018
.

Therefore
it
would
be
better
to
contribute
to
good
relations
between
girls
and
boys
starting
from
years
of
school
and
university
.

The
amount
of
people
who
were
n't
busy
were
decreased
from
6,8
%
to
5,8
percent
.

It
is
interesting
that
percentage
of
money
which
spended
on
print
books
in
germany
leveled
off
for
all
time
.

There
are
two
dominating
groups
:
30
-
49
year
group
and
50
-
64
year
group
which
shares
are
almost
same
.

Sometimes
it
is
better
to
take
a
break
after
school
and
have
a
rest
for
a
year
.

Between
1980
and
2030
took
place
a
significant
jump
in
population
.

They
will
decrease
from
61,6
%
in
2000
to
approximately
46,2
%
in
2050
.

Finally
,
if
we
compare
book
sellings
in
Germany
and
China
by
the
year
of
2014
,
we
can
say
that
their
figures
of
money
are
nearly
equal
.

The
most
unusual
qualifications
is
level
who
give
skilled
vocational
diploma
for
students
,
because
the
so
percent
of
people
educated
theare
are
men
.

In
my
opinion
,
government
should
allowed
to
express
ideas
and
thoughts
stronly
really
good
artists
.

In
75
years
old
man
spent
only
around
29
minuts
on
sport
,
while
woman
spent
a
way
over
this
amount
,
10
minuts
.

Touching
upon
the
theme
of
visits
to
and
from
the
UK
it
is
important
to
note
that
visits
abroad
by
UK
residents
and
visits
to
the
UK
by
overseas
residents
increased
throughout
the
whole
period
.

The
number
decrease
by
rail
and
road
.

This
reason
can
be
but
I
prefer
another
one
which
is
to
do
what
students
want
.

The
time
they
spent
doing
exercises
reached
282,1
minutes
.

Furthermore
,
people
can
be
stressed
if
they
do
not
know
how
to
fix
the
broken
computer
that
they
are
working
on
,
which
impacts
our
nerves
system
and
does
not
let
humans
'
bodies
regulate
natural
processes
.

Despite
there
being
a
lot
of
debates
about
the
opportunity
of
using
any
drugs
in
order
to
increase
sport
skills
,
sportsmen
should
stay
carefull
,
because
such
measures
might
destroy
their
health
.

People
need
more
gyms
,
yards
with
sports
facilities
and
so
on
.

In
conclusion
,
there
are
a
couple
of
problems
with
health
in
modern
society
because
of
technology
,
and
we
can
change
it
.

However
,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
brought
up
by
loving
and
smart
parents
will
always
stay
a
good
person
no
matter
how
different
the
surrounding
reality
is
.

We
should
remember
about
it
in
difficult
times
,
and
do
our
best
to
save
each
life
.

But
the
largest
capaceldy
has
a
Tokyo
subway
system
which
was
opened
in
1927
and
works
for
1927
million
passengers
a
year
.

The
situation
with
crime
in
recent
years
has
changed
so
that
most
of
the
illegal
actions
are
being
commited
by
the
youth
.

This
has
to
be
illegal
to
allow
children
to
use
phones
.

To
sum
up
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
crime
can
really
ruin
and
spoil
our
society
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
levels
of
post
-
school
qualifications
and
the
gender
percentage
proportion
of
people
who
held
them
in
Australia
in
1999
.

Although
it
was
opened
earlier
than
one
in
Los
Angeles
,
in
1981
and
2001
respectively
,
the
route
is
shorter
than
in
Los
Angeles
:
11
and
28
respectively
.

First
of
all
,
many
researches
proved
that
there
are
high
rates
of
crime
nowadays
due
to
the
fact
that
younger
people
commit
crimes
.

Nowadays
,
it
's
quite
hard
for
children
to
get
some
not
very
complicated
job
.

The
govenrments
of
all
countries
should
pay
more
attention
to
providing
scientists
with
money
because
it
will
help
to
keep
the
balance
between
consequent
profit
and
safety
.

It
took
61.6
%
in
2000
and
is
expected
to
breakdown
to
46.2
%
.

The
percentages
of
master
's
degree
for
female
was
40
per
cent
in
1999
and
the
percentage
of
males
to
reach
60
per
cent
.

The
large
number
of
girls
usually
is
in
humanitarian
subjects
,
whereas
boys
prefer
technical
ones
.

I
am
agree
with
the
statemant
'
we
need
to
understand
why
is
this
happening
and
make
something
to
change
the
situation
.

Its
unemployment
rate
is
6,8
in
2014
and
5,8
in
2015
.

However
,
some
our
heighbours
may
suffer
from
wars
or
natural
disusters
.

It
is
also
necessary
to
notice
,
that
amount
of
retired
people
in
Yemen
took
a
very
small
part
of
population
in
2000
and
,
according
to
predictions
,
this
situation
will
follow
a
similar
pattern
in
2050
.

As
for
industry
employment
,
there
are
almost
twice
more
people
working
in
Australia
than
in
Indonesia
and
they
make
up
32
%
and
11
%
of
male
and
female
gender
respectively
.

According
to
the
chart
is
higher
in
skilled
vocational
diplomas
,
postgraduate
diplomas
and
masters
degrees
,
whereas
women
dominated
in
undergratuate
diplomas
and
bachelor
's
degrees
.

For
instance
,
additional
training
in
a
profession
or
a
specific
skill
is
often
costly
,
and
those
who
value
the
quality
of
their
work
inevitably
have
to
sacrifice
their
free
time
and
invest
money
in
life
-
long
education
.

Speaking
about
German
people
,
their
earnings
vary
between
20
and
12
percent
,
starting
with
the
year
of
1980
and
ending
in
1995
with
a
percentage
fall
.

Another
point
is
that
student
do
not
see
his
teacher
as
a
head
,
as
a
leader
.

It
is
crucial
to
prevent
this
process
from
futher
expansion
and
in
this
case
we
should
understand
the
causes
of
this
development
and
try
to
figure
out
appropriate
sollutions
.

These
world
regions
are
North
Africa
,
South
Africa
and
Worldwide
.

Some
pirates
created
online
cinemas
,
where
people
could
see
films
free
.

And
number
of
men
who
had
master
's
degree
were
on
a
half
more
than
number
of
women
.

This
tendency
is
occurring
in
all
of
the
countries
that
are
shown
in
the
graph
.

This
essay
agrees
with
the
statement
because
any
little
crime
is
still
a
crime
.

Finally
,
we
can
emphasise
that
eBook
market
rises
meanwhile
printed
book
market
constantly
decreases
through
4
years
.

Moreover
,
there
are
some
sport
fans
who
too
keen
on
thair
favourit
team
and
it
can
lead
to
having
an
arguments
with
fans
of
another
team
.

When
people
share
ideas
,
then
they
can
create
something
new
and
different
restrictions
stop
the
process
of
creation
.

Moreover
,
87
%
of
adults
aged
18
-
29
use
Facebook
.

UK
has
slightly
reduced
its
difference
in
earnings
starting
with
over
35
per
cent
in
1980
and
ending
with
less
than
25
per
cent
in
1995
.

Speaking
about
Instagram
,
so
there
is
a
sudden
fall
in
using
among
people
at
the
age
of
30
-
49
.

Children
think
that
If
he
do
somethin
bad
noone
do
him
to
stop
him
.

All
networks
are
very
popular
,
but
,
as
it
is
shown
on
,
\"
Facebook
\"
is
the
most
essential
resourse
.

Secondly
,
the
atmosphere
in
school
itself
is
important
.

At
first
,
legal
copes
are
mostly
very
expensive
so
users
have
not
another
choice
exept
download
illegal
ones
.

It
means
that
there
are
less
callories
spent
and
there
is
less
blood
cerculation
.

Goverment
loses
additional
profit
from
faxes
,
consumers
does
n't
have
incentive
to
spent
money
on
entertainment
.

There
was
a
huge
research
in
order
to
demonstrate
how
devices
affect
our
brains
.

It
is
also
noticeable
that
in
both
1990
and
2005
bigger
percentage
of
boys
than
girls
did
physical
exercises
regularly
(
87
%
and
57
%
compared
to
77
%
and
51
%
)
.

The
data
dan
not
changed
at
all
,
staying
in
12,5
%
and
3,9
%
accordingly
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
that
local
calls
were
significantly
bigger
than
others
types
of
calls
during
the
whole
period
.

The
lifestyle
which
does
n't
let
a
person
even
know
if
he
or
she
has
some
meal
in
a
kitchen
to
eat
for
a
day
makes
him
/
her
steal
because
this
sort
of
\"
earning
money
\"
looks
as
the
quickest
one
.

Proportion
of
population
in
Sweden
and
USA
in
1940
was
about
8
%
and
will
gradualy
rise
up
to
25
%
in
2040
.

The
charts
below
represent
the
differences
between
the
ages
of
the
populations
of
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
projections
for
2050
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
from
the
graph
that
the
percentage
of
older
people
in
Japan
decreased
slightly
from
1940
to
1960
and
remained
steady
during
the
period
of
twenty
years
on
the
level
about
3
%
at
which
point
it
started
to
grow
in
in
1990
.

Overall
,
it
can
be
seen
from
the
graph
that
nowadays
the
main
users
of
the
Internet
are
young
people
in
the
first
age
group
from
18
to
29
.

Then
follows
the
amount
of
manufactured
goods
.

There
are
many
argues
about
theese
photos
because
on
the
one
hand
people
must
know
the
truth
about
government
in
the
Arabic
countries
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
theese
photos
are
not
ethic
.

When
we
make
this
type
of
food
for
other
countries
we
give
them
chance
to
know
our
country
better
and
explain
our
traditions
.

It
is
normal
for
people
to
get
money
for
their
job
.

The
most
important
factors
are
good
health
,
family
and
friends
,
and
hobbies
,
which
discussed
below
.

Only
15
%
of
students
of
the
science
courses
are
above
40
.

The
bar
chart
below
provides
information
about
the
percentage
of
various
age
's
people
who
uses
such
social
networks
like
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
Linledln
in
rhe
USA
.

Old
population
of
Sweden
rose
from
12
%
to
20
%
in
period
from
1990
to
2010
,
slightly
decreased
in
2015
.

What
is
more
,
some
part
of
population
do
not
do
sport
for
their
condion
of
health
.

Chemicals
increased
from
11
%
to
16
%
.

Besides
,
marchinery
goods
hiting
their
peak
at
12
per
cent
wich
transported
by
rail
in
sprite
of
the
amount
of
mentioned
goods
transported
by
road
rech
their
peak
at
just
2
per
cent
.

People
prefer
air
machines
because
it
is
seems
more
safe
and
comfortable
.

But
I
will
analyse
two
sides
of
this
quastion
.

By
the
reason
of
constant
using
of
modern
devices
many
people
have
headaches
,
can
see
badly
and
may
have
a
lot
of
other
deseases
.

The
highest
point
of
fossil
fuels
'
energy
production
could
be
spotted
in
1970
at
sharply
95
%
.

Additionally
,
the
equal
number
of
students
includes
violence
because
of
the
possibility
that
man
or
woman
would
not
want
to
complete
the
subject
but
have
to
according
to
proportional
rules
.

The
maximum
temperature
in
July
,
which
is
the
central
point
in
summer
,
is
nearly
25
degrees
.

Because
,
there
would
n't
be
jobs
only
for
women
and
for
men
.

Nowaday
,
people
have
an
opinion
that
some
gadgets
can
be
a
problem
of
growing
health
problems
.

The
number
of
them
was
54
%
.

If
the
athlet
took
a
drug
only
one
out
of
the
team
,
he
or
she
should
be
given
limited
prohibition
due
to
his
or
her
right
to
be
treated
as
a
human
,
who
is
allowed
to
make
one
mistake
.

In
addition
,
the
highest
proprtions
of
adults
from
\"
30
-
49
\"
and
\"
50
-
64
\"
age
groups
use
the
social
network
called
LinkedIn
.

For
example
it
is
very
popular
nowadays
to
have
technics
,
like
robot
,
that
can
clean
your
house
and
wash
your
dishes
.

And
it
in
20
centure
people
who
lived
far
from
cities
hardly
had
proportions
of
households
with
Internet
connection
.

It
is
up
to
a
person
to
decide
.

To
conclude
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
there
is
a
number
of
pros
and
cons
of
the
question
who
should
invest
money
in
research
private
companies
or
government
.

Such
people
who
always
try
to
earn
more
and
more
money
see
an
opportunity
to
his
or
her
future
life
in
getting
various
things
.

Firstly
,
there
is
a
serious
problem
of
polluting
our
environment
.

However
,
men
who
hold
Undergraduate
diploma
only
36
per
cent
.

Now
situation
is
different
.

Moreover
,
sport
could
be
a
reason
of
different
illnesses
.

Firstly
,
they
are
sure
that
process
of
personal
development
is
controlled
by
those
characteristics
and
they
give
us
our
special
way
of
behaviour
.

One
possible
reason
for
it
is
a
fear
of
not
being
understood
.

Secondly
,
the
person
can
easily
download
any
product
he
likes
without
using
extra
devices
.

On
the
other
hand
,
sometimes
we
can
not
fully
trust
a
research
,
funded
by
government
,
as
countries
often
have
a
vested
interest
in
the
findings
.

The
given
chart
provides
the
information
about
unemployment
rate
in
various
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

Nevertheless
,
the
question
is
not
such
an
easy
as
it
seems
at
the
first
time
.

To
sum
up
,
young
generation
prefer
communication
via
the
Internet
more
often
than
elderly
people
.

The
second
chart
gives
information
about
goods
that
are
tranported
by
rail
.

But
another
groups
also
use
Facebook
actively
.

I
disagree
with
the
statement
and
suppose
,
that
producing
food
only
for
your
own
population
is
means
such
tight
of
character
as
greed
.

Moreover
,
person
,
wanting
to
get
a
piece
of
happiness
should
provide
more
hours
with
relatives
and
close
people
and
do
not
spend
all
of
the
free
time
at
work
It
was
the
recent
survey
resulting
from
a
poll
proving
this
point
of
view
.

I
believe
that
government
do
not
should
restrict
creative
people
like
artists
,
film
directors
and
musicians
in
their
creative
.

Thirdly
,
people
who
copy
and
share
films
and
old
music
made
it
only
for
money
,
it
looks
like
theft
from
you
house
in
order
to
sell
it
on
the
black
market
.

However
,
some
people
can
not
agree
with
rhis
statement
.

The
phone
may
be
the
reason
of
it
too
.

The
negative
influence
of
modern
gadgets
can
be
easily
noticied
in
everyday
life
.

But
,
what
the
songs
we
listen
when
they
are
n't
for
sale
?

What
is
more
,
more
often
big
corporations
have
an
opportunity
to
pay
every
equipment
during
the
exploration
,
while
governments
have
limited
amount
of
money
,
that
they
can
afford
themself
to
spend
for
the
science
.

To
begin
with
,
the
main
characteristics
of
the
countries
at
the
start
of
the
period
are
that
Yemen
's
population
is
mostly
divided
between
children
up
to
14
years
and
grown
-
ups
under
the
age
of
60
,
with
a
slight
prevailance
of
youngsters
and
almost
unconsiderable
amount
of
elderly
with
3,6
%
,
while
Italy
has
almost
two
thirds
of
it
population
(
61,6
%
)
in
the
working
age
gap
and
about
a
quarter
(
24,1
%
)
of
the
nation
is
over
60
years
in
age
,
leaving
14,3
%
for
children
,
as
opposed
to
50,1
%
in
Yemen
.

All
in
all
,
on
the
graph
and
on
the
pie
chart
we
can
notice
that
in
winter
the
quantity
of
units
of
electrisity
using
rises
.

Sonetimes
they
have
to
spend
hours
without
rest
behind
the
monitor
.

For
my
own
experience
I
can
make
comparison
that
choising
proportional
system
in
education
is
really
very
important
part
.

Speaking
about
my
personal
opinion
,
I
believe
that
when
country
relies
on
it
's
population
interests
and
preferences
,
it
lets
to
create
.

Besides
,
I
understand
that
there
are
some
pros
of
import
like
a
big
choice
,
the
change
of
experience
and
maybe
some
others
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
needless
to
sum
up
,
that
in
2000
the
main
tendence
is
the
difference
between
0
-
14
year
old
people
and
in
20
50
it
is
the
difference
between
60
+
year
old
people
in
different
countries
.

The
diagramm
compare
changes
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
different
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

Nowadays
a
lot
of
young
people
are
willing
not
to
lose
any
time
of
their
lifes
.

Although
the
situation
is
complicated
many
things
can
be
done
to
solve
the
problem
.

The
information
is
relevant
for
a
college
in
the
United
Kingdom
in
2012
.

The
number
of
metals
transported
by
road
is
only
11
per
cent
.

While
for
chemicals
the
rail
is
more
prefered
-
16
%
.

However
,
while
US
residents
tended
to
go
abroad
,
the
number
of
visits
to
the
UK
was
about
30
millions
.

Tourists
from
all
over
the
world
visit
countries
with
their
adorable
food
like
for
example
,
for
pizza
in
Italy
.

So
,
phones
influence
not
only
the
psychological
state
of
person
,
but
also
,
of
coruse
,
peoples
vision
.

Hence
,
the
government
should
take
some
more
effective
actions
to
improve
the
situation
with
population
's
health
.

Latin
America
had
6,8
%
of
unemployment
rate
in
2014
.

In
conclusion
,
I
suppose
that
it
is
better
to
continue
studies
straightaway
after
finishing
high
school
.

Of
course
,
doing
sport
every
day
may
have
a
positive
influence
on
person
's
health
.

At
the
same
time
the
percentage
of
rural
households
was
soaring
from
2
%
in
1999
to
just
35
%
in
selected
2004
.

In
1995
the
percentage
of
boys
and
girls
was
the
same
-
more
than
15
%
.

Metals
occupied
here
only
eleven
percent
,
proportion
of
minerals
and
chemicals
were
a
bit
larger
.

But
please
:
what
will
they
understand
?

We
can
observe
that
the
mamimum
temperature
in
June
-
July
is
about
25
°
C
.

So
the
percentage
of
unemployed
people
in
North
Africa
accounts
for
12,5
in
both
years
,
2014
and
2015
.

Nevertheless
,
eBook
market
in
Germany
didnot
reach
a
peak
,
only
1,5
Billion
US
Dollars
was
spent
on
the
development
.

But
public
health
did
not
improve
due
to
small
budget
of
healthcare
organisations
and
big
number
of
immigrants
from
poor
regions
.

Firstly
,
the
number
of
transported
manufactured
goods
remains
at
the
same
level
with
25
%
of
goods
are
transported
by
rail
and
28
%
by
road
.

These
three
pie
-
charts
depict
the
attendence
of
different
cources
among
people
of
different
ages
.

Fristly
,
te
bigger
number
of
flights
in
the
sky
can
create
more
dangerous
situation
because
in
such
case
the
navigation
becomes
more
complicated
.

In
fact
,
the
number
of
users
of
\"
Facebook
\"
goes
gradually
down
by
the
age
.

Also
there
was
a
slight
increase
in
EU
to
7,9
%
.

Sharing
pirate
copies
of
movies
and
music
is
a
burning
issue
nowadays
because
people
who
made
them
do
not
get
any
money
.

Another
reason
which
is
noted
by
specialists
is
a
wish
to
seem
better
,
stronger
for
somebody
(
boys
fight
,
girls
look
at
the
winner
)
.

As
an
example
we
can
take
a
businessman
who
whorks
for
hours
,
has
a
prestige
job
and
has
expensive
clothes
.

A
lot
of
scientists
of
economics
belive
that
a
production
of
food
should
cover
all
their
country
's
needs
but
this
Mercantism
in
the
food
production
has
problems
in
the
vary
of
food
,
better
conditions
to
growth
more
and
specializing
on
production
that
is
most
effective
for
country
.

The
pie
charts
below
illustrate
data
on
the
ages
of
the
population
of
Yemen
and
Italy
over
5
decades
,
from
2000
to
2050
.

Young
generation
become
,
in
adalts
opinion
,
more
stressed
.

What
is
more
,
there
will
always
be
different
rumors
around
this
athlet
Such
a
difficult
and
stressful
situation
may
cause
depression
and
low
self
-
estime
.

Moreover
,
some
drugs
today
can
cause
genes
and
DNA
changes
in
future
children
,
which
is
not
a
dopping
or
a
flood
.

However
,
in
my
opinion
,
people
can
not
deny
that
those
characteristics
have
much
more
influence
of
their
lives
than
any
future
life
experiences
.

Some
people
like
watching
British
and
American
films
and
prefer
them
to
locally
produced
films
.

It
means
that
it
is
cheap
to
produce
some
kind
of
food
.

The
table

the
underground
railway
networks
of
several
large
cities
.

In
addition
,
the
possibily
to
help
humans
from
all
over
the
world
can
inspire
the
power
of
people
's
character
.

A
country
can
build
up
a
factory
with
conditions
that
are
required
,
but
the
costs
will
be
too
much
.

In
addition
,
the
United
States
of
America
and
China
both
have
the
highest
percentage
of
energy
from
gas
emissions
,
reaching
their
peak
at
about
90
and
80
per
cent
respectively
.

Furthermore
,
the
level
of
unemployment
in
North
Africa
,
S.
Asia
and
in
the
whole
world
standed
on
the
previous
level
.

The
line
of
muximum
temperature
has
the
same
form
as
a
line
of
minimum
.

30
%
of
roads
are
provided
for
food
products
.

Overall
,
while
temperature
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
changes
significantly
throughout
the
period
,
figures
given
for
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brasil
fluctuate
just
slightly
over
the
year
.

According
to
another
graph
it
can
be
noticed
that
more
than
ten
million
of
UK
visitors
choose
for
their
trips
France
,
which
is
about
one
fifth
of
the
all
visits
abroad
.

So
,
it
can
lead
to
the
profit
of
the
country
's
budget
.

It
is
difficult
to
transform
them
,
so
it
is
better
to
use
them
in
a
right
way
.

The
chart
reveals
that
the
UK
citizens
were
more
likely
to
travel
in
Europe
,
and
especially
,
France
and
Spain
which
took
most
of
the
visitors
.

The
graph
below
illustrates
the
difference
between
female
and
male
incomings
throughout
15
years
in
5
different
countries
.

To
sum
up
,
the
population
of
people
aged
65
and
over
will
significantly
increase
in
presented
countries
to
2040
.

Some
people
think
that
countries
must
produce
kind
of
food
,
which
population
eats
in
this
country
and
must
have
goal
-
maximum
reduce
import
.

The
second
place
belongs
to
Middle
East
,
but
the
level
of
unemployment
had
slight
decrease
from
11
%
to
9,6
%
.

The
provided
chart
illustrates
the
percentage
difference
in
earnings
between
men
and
women
in
five
different
countries
-
Japan
,
USA
,
UK
,
Germany
and
New
Zealand
.

This
people
often
have
creative
ideas
and
they
want
to
show
them
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
student
is
not
occupied
and
if
lesson
is
boring
,
student
will
try
to
find
some
entertainment
and
may
cause
some
obstacles
during
the
educational
process
.

In
general
,
both
tables
presents
three
most
popular
sectors
:
agriculture
,
industry
and
services
.

The
common
trend
is
that
obesity
rate
has
increased
over
the
years
in
both
genders
.

We
all
work
to
earn
money
,
but
some
people
work
less
,
earn
less
money
,
but
have
more
free
time
,
and
some
people
work
more
,
earn
more
but
have
not
got
any
free
time
at
all
.

Nowadays
there
are
a
lot
of
creative
people
in
our
world
.

Also
we
can
notice
that
period
from
June
to
August
is
the
warmest
one
for
Yakutsk
and
the
coldest
for
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

Economic
isolation
is
not
the
way
to
solve
the
problems
.

They
are
young
and
active
,
majority
of
them
are
optimistic
and
really
interested
in
communicating
.

As
well
as
younger
people
were
sporty
,
the
oldest
were
non
-
sporty
:
men
and
women
over
75
together
spent
less
time
doing
sport
than
one
of
seven
part
of
time
which
men
in
age
group
16
-
24
did
.

Some
people
think
that
housing
should
achieve
only
one
goal
,
be
practical
and
beneficial
.

All
in
all
,
people
can
change
their
opinions
from
time
to
time
.

Middle
East
had
11
%
unemployment
rate
,
that
was
more
than
the
same
indicator
in
EU
by
3,5
%
.

The
pie
diagrams
show
transportation
of
goods
in
Eastern
Europe
.

Furthermore
,
the
USA
print
book
market
in
2014
is
the
highest
critical
point
in
the
chart
.

The
cart
show
us
,
that
the
least
difference
between
male
and
female
groups
has
a
bachelor
's
degree
:
regarding
for
females
it
takes
the
third
place
(
more
than
50
%
)
and
for
male
it
takes
the
second
place
(
less
than
50
%
)
.

But
on
the
other
hand
,
the
experiences
you
Farr
trough
your
development
,
because
you
develop
together
with
your
experiences
and
under
their
influence
.

The
amount
of
electricity
during
typical
days
in
winter
is
between
30000
and
45000
,
however
in
summer
the
consumption
less
-
the
amount
flutuations
between
10000
and
20000
.

However
,
there
are
arguments
on
whether
the
sportsmen
who
were
caught
cheating
this
way
should
be
banned
from
competing
for
the
whole
lives
or
just
for
some
time
.

In
conclusion
,
pirating
music
and
movies
is
illegal
and
should
be
punished
,
but
there
are
some
reasons
why
people
who
do
this
should
n't
be
judged
,
by
people
who
do
n't
,
to
harsh
,
as
there
are
some
nuances
in
modern
society
that
lead
people
to
stealing
things
on
the
Internet
.

Personally
,
I
agree
that
people
who
shared
music
and
films
should
be
punished
somehow
,
but
not
very
strict
,
as
not
many
users
of
the
Internet
are
aware
of
copyright
existence
and
they
are
used
to
gain
all
the
things
,
like
films
and
music
,
in
the
Internet
without
paying
any
sums
of
money
.

The
coclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
it
is
really
up
to
one
what
to
choose
:
man
-
made
concept
or
paper
bills
,
but
as
the
saying
goes
\"
time
is
money
\"
.

And
what
about
changes
in
the
European
Union
the
level
of
unemployment
increase
from
7,5
to
7,9
per
sent
.
the
uneployment
rate
became
lower
in
Middle
East
and
in
Latin
America
from
2014
to
2015
.

The
issue
of
upbringing
has
always
been
a
much
discussed
one
.

From
15
to
20
usage
of
electricity
practically
did
n't
change
.

Individuals
and
groups
of
people
work
together
and
persuade
companies
to
make
films
but
pirate
copies
are
able
to
lower
their
income
very
much
.

This
programme
would
also
be
benefitable
for
the
charities
,
which
often
do
n't
have
enough
people
to
achieve
their
goals
,
and
for
the
whole
community
in
general
.

For
instance
,
sientific
researsh
had
shown
that
we
become
similar
with
our
parents
and
siblings
in
first
several
years
because
of
a
great
contact
with
them
.

Moreover
,
people
are
likely
to
earn
more
money
and
restrict
their
free
time
due
to
their
own
beliefs
and
features
of
character
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
may
not
be
so
simple
.

While
the
minimum
average
temperature
there
flactuated
at
the
level
of
35
degrees
Celcies
below
zero
,
having
the
peak
at
25
degrees
Celcies
over
zero
in
July
.

From
other
side
South
Asia
is
a
country
with
the
lowest
quantity
of
unemployment
people
-
3,9
percents
of
people
who
have
not
got
a
job
.

This
way
of
transportation
was
ordinary
used
for
food
products
.

It
can
bring
in
our
life
creative
and
fresh
views
and
ways
of
solving
problems
.

As
a
results
,
we
can
say
that
average
English
house
by
obvious
reason
spend
more
electric
energy
during
winter
,
but
we
ca
n't
compare
a
pie
chart
to
graph
because
it
shows
only
general
trend
,
not
separate
information
for
summer
and
winter
.

He
or
she
are
affected
by
the
desire
to
earn
more
money
and
gain
new
goal
-
it
's
some
kind
of
a
competition
with
yourself
.

To
sum
everything
up
,
today
there
are
more
advantages
than
disadvantages
when
the
private
companies
will
carry
out
and
invest
their
money
into
the
science
.

In
this
case
countries
need
to
help
each
others
and
their
aim
to
import
only
fresh
food
.

Overall
,
providing
data
on
the
empoyment
by
gender
,
it
is
quite
obvious
to
emphasize
that
all
the
female
workers
in
both
countries
work
more
in
Services
and
Agriculture
(
exept
Australian
women
here
)
,
while
the
male
workers
prefere
to
work
in
the
Industry
sphere
.

On
the
one
hand
,
it
is
undoubtedly
stressful
to
start
university
studies
just
after
the
passing
high
school
graduation
exams
.

And
finally
,
I
believe
that
there
is
no
building
that
can
not
serve
any
purpose
at
all
,
if
it
is
produced
carefully
and
follows
the
rules
of
architecture
.

The
question
is
whether
it
is
a
cure
for
some
urgent
problem
or
blossom
.

And
human
beings
are
too
busy
to
spent
time
even
with
their
family
.

After
that
,
the
following
stead
trend
is
'
Chemicals
'
with
11
per
cent
by
rail
and
16
%
by
road
.

However
,
there
are
people
who
argue
,
that
the
charecteristics
we
are
born
with
are
far
from
important
.

According
to
the
graph
,
only
13
%
of
people
from
urban
and
suburban
territories
only
2
-
3
%
of
people
had
acces
to
the
Internet
.

Nowadays
there
are
big
numbers
of
works
and
jobs
where
could
be
employed
male
and
female
persons
at
the
equal
level
.

Therefore
,
in
my
opinion
this
process
may
be
more
pleasant
in
a
way
,
when
firstly
you
can
download
it
for
-
free
and
if
you
satisfied
with
a
product
you
can
fund
any
amount
of
money
to
a
content
-
maker
.

For
instance
,
new
films
,
especially
thrillers
and
horrors
,
can
create
in
person
's
mind
fear
,
hatred
or
depression
.

Metals
are
also
transported
by
rail
in
most
cases
,
with
the
percentage
of
35
among
all
other
goods
.

The
line
graphs
give
data
about
temperatures
with
maximum
and
minimum
numbers
over
the
period
of
12
months
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

To
sum
up
,
I
agree
with
both
views
.

Meanwhile
in
Russia
you
will
considered
to
be
a
vierd
person
.
if
you
suggest
you
friends
to
pay
for
a
movie
in
online
-
cinema
,
eventhoug
there
is
a
low
that
forbides
doing
that
.

The
energy
of
fossil
fuels
of
France
and
Canada
with
the
percentage
of
90
and
82
respectively
was
decreasing
untill
2015
,
ending
with
the
lowest
point
of
50
%
for
France
and
lower
than
30
for
Sweden
.

It
can
be
providing
an
image
of
different
professions
and
better
under
standing
of
how
they
may
live
when
they
grow
.

The
line
of
Japan
population
states
to
go
up
after
2020
dramatically
and
the
othe
countries
have
more
stable
rise
.

Globalization
makes
us
all
to
get
more
interested
in
multinational
brands
,
however
it
causes
that
small
local
businesses
are
being
replaced
with
large
.

In
conclusion
,
we
can
see
that
the
main
tendency
in
Yemen
is
increasing
of
middle
-
age
group
and
in
Italy
is
decreasing
middle
-
age
group
and
growth
of
old
people
to
2050
.

Moreover
,
public
health
depends
not
only
on
sport
.

The
line
of
maximum
average
temperatures
in
Yakutsk
in
January
indicate
temperature
about
-
45
degreess
.

There
is
an
arguement
that
defining
happiness
is
inconpenenseble
.

To
begin
with
,
all
subjects
can
be
divided
into
several
groups
.

Of
course
the
life
experience
also
train
you
.

For
example
,
our
country
have
fertile
lands
but
do
not
growth
neccesary
amount
of
potatoes
.

Finally
,
other
countries
are
to
receive
help
in
terms
of
the
overall
prosperity
of
the
humanity
.

To
conclude
,
this
essay
support
healthy
lifestyle
because
it
help
to
fight
with
the
negative
consequences
of
overusing
of
electronic
devices
.

According
to
the
graph
,
it
is
clearly
seen
that
the
amount
of
metals
transporting
by
rail
is
much
more
bigger
then
metals
transporting
by
road
,
it
is
respectivly
35
%
and
11
%
.

Overall
,
it
's
edident
that
people
of
non
-
white
origin
make
up
a
significant
part
in
the
prison
population
in
both
countries
.

According
to
the
charts
,
illustrated
population
of
Yemen
,
the
proportion
of
people
0
-
14
years
old
comprised
50.1
per
cent
from
total
population
.

But
there
is
one
more
obvious
thing
here
.

For
Sweden
it
was
23
%
while
it
accounted
for
29
%
for
the
USA
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
dependence
of
the
age
group
to
the
use
of
three
various
social
networks
(
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
Linked
In
)
in
the
USA
.

Secondly
,
increasing
the
level
of
the
people
sport
life
can
only
be
achieve
by
using
a
complex
of
different
measures
like
populatization
of
healthy
lifestyle
through
commercials
and
press
,
providing
public
health
exerciseses
and
make
agitation
to
attract
more
people
into
this
new
kind
of
life
,
that
will
be
much
better
for
them
.

The
graphs
describe
the
average
highest
and
lowest
temperatures
in
two
cities
,
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

Maybe
more
creative
people
will
abuse
this
freedom
and
will
lead
racket
.

The
problem
of
virtual
life
can
be
reduced
if
we
would
use
it
in
different
spherese
,
for
instance
,
in
aircraft
education
.

However
,
there
is
a
need
to
discriminate
males
and
females
by
their
interests
and
abilities
.

They
consider
school
being
the
most
effective
and
sufficient
way
to
achieve
goals
and
percieve
social
status
.

In
USA
the
figure
was
fluctuated
between
10
and
15
percent
and
this
situation
will
change
in
the
2020
,
because
there
will
be
a
significant
raice
in
number
of
people
aged
65
and
over
.

The
data
presented
refers
to
2010
and
shows
the
trends
in
two
countries
,
namely
Indonesia
and
Australia
.

The
first
table
illustrates
Indonesia
,
the
second
one
shows
Australia
.

Overall
,
the
persentage
of
the
networks
'
users
depends
on
their
age
,
since
yonger
generation
outnumbered
the
oler
people
.

The
most
noticeable
feature
of
the
data
is
that
development
of
print
market
in
all
countries
(
excluded
Germany
)
will
become
lower
by
2018
;
whereas
eBook
trade
increase
slowly
,
but
surely
.

So
we
may
notice
that
all
of
the
lines
go
up
,
it
means
that
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
within
years
years
will
be
higher
and
higher
.

By
intruding
in
these
problems
,
other
countries
could
possibly
make
the
situation
worse
and
it
could
potentially
lead
to
great
conflicts
and
even
wars
.

The
graph
and
the
pie
chart
give
some
information
about
using
electricity
in
summer
in
comparision
to
in
winter
,
as
well
as
for
what
reasons
.

To
begin
with
,
the
first
table
presents
data
collected
in
Indonesia
.

These
age
groups
are
:
children
to
14
years
old
,
people
from
15
to
59
years
,
and
eldery
people
of
age
of
60
and
more
.

Above
17,5
%
needs
for
ovens
,
kettles
and
washing
machines
.

In
my
opinion
,
such
sportsmen
who
broke
the
law
should
be
panished
for
a
short
-
term
period
and
then
have
a
chance
to
come
back
to
competitions
.

Overall
,
to
my
mind
,
suggested
idea
mainly
aimed
to
solve
the
problem
of
inequality
,
will
only
exacerbate
the
situation
,
leading
to
a
more
serious
descrepancy
between
men
and
women
.

Nowadays
people
have
two
opinions
about
the
prisoniers
and
about
people
who
make
crimes
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
another
opinion
that
everybody
can
get
a
chance
.

Besides
,
there
are
some
almost
female
professions
,
such
as
teachers
,
nurses
and
workers
in
kindergardens
.

And
what
about
free
time
for
walking
?

In
fact
,
on
of
the
most
modern
subways
in
Kyoto
has
the
least
number
of
passengers
and
has
the
shortest
route
:
11
Kilometres
.

That
is
why
many
people
try
to
get
money
illegally
,
because
it
is
the
only
way
they
have
access
to
.

They
should
be
active
in
their
lives
.

The
USA
had
the
highest
sales
of
both
kinds
of
books
:
printed
ones
were
sold
for
ten
and
a
half
billion
dollars
,
while
eBooks
were
sold
for
five
and
a
half
.

That
gives
a
competition
for
country
's
cimpani
,
which
will
cause
them
to
make
there
food
better
and/or
cheaper
.

Almost
all
information
is
open
and
available
in
the
Internet
.

I
strongly
believe
,
that
the
only
fear
of
the
death
can
reduce
the
crime
.

Fossil
fuels
make
up
only
about
a
half
of
energy
production
in
France
,
and
less
,
than
a
third
in
Sweden
.

Horizontal
axis
represents
the
percentage
of
men
and
women
while
vertical
axis
shows
the
levels
of
qualifications
.

The
second
factor
that
plenty
of
human
beings
find
vital
is
obtaining
enough
income
.

While
others
claim
that
it
would
not
have
that
impact
and
suggest
to
take
other
measures
in
consideration
as
well
.

After
that
the
number
of
visits
increased
more
slowly
.

I
think
,
that
it
destroys
our
society
.

It
can
be
seen
by
an
example
of
a
reseurch
project
about
natural
life
which
was
writted
by
sociologist
Tomas
Korn
from
United
Kingdom
at
the
beginning
of
21
centure
.

In
the
next
group
are
people
of
the
age
of
30
-
49
.

The
line
chart
illustrates
the
percentage
of
seniour
citizens
from
1940
to
2040
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
the
USA
.

As
well
as
this
there
's
also
a
chance
that
drugs
can
leave
traces
in
blood
and
even
change
it
,
so
the
sportsmen
or
sportswomen
will
be
\"
marked
\"
for
the
rest
of
the
life
.

And
only
3,6
%
of
people
of
Yemen
older
then
60
years
.

First
of
al
,
people
who
do
not
believe
in
use
of
sport
facilities
say
that
young
people
today
do
not
need
it
,
for
them
it
is
better
to
stay
at
home
,
watching
TV
and
playing
computer
games
,
and
even
if
there
are
some
sport
grounds
youngsters
prefer
to
drink
and
smoke
there
.

There
is
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
number
of
women
with
undergraduate
diploma
at
75
%
with
less
sharp
decrease
of
men
in
this
category
with
the
percentage
stands
at
40
%
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
free
copies
on
the
Internet
make
less
harm
than
they
are
thought
to
.

It
also
should
be
as
fireproof
as
possible
.

Besides
,
you
can
relax
after
the
final
exams
.

And
it
could
be
better
to
spend
them
on
solving
society
problems
.

The
The
outcome
outcome
depends
depends
on
on
age
age
.
.

For
instance
,
people
who
working
in
design
sphere
should
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
computers
for
creating
new
products
.

It
is
expected
that
in
2018
the
amount
of
print
will
fall
to
4,2
billion
of
US
dollars
,
while
the
amount
of
eBook
will
grow
to
1
billion
US
dollars
.

All
in
all
,
metals
took
the
leading
position
on
transportation
by
rail
,
and
food
production
took
the
majority
of
road
transportations
.

This
graph
illustrates
the
percentage
of
older
people
in
three
countries
:
Japan
,
Sweden
,
USA
from
1940
to
2040
.

Afterwards
,
it
has
a
downward
trend
reaching
the
lowest
figure
of
-
40
°
C
in
December
.

It
is
also
a
good
way
to
have
a
rest
after
a
difficult
day
.

In
conclusion
I
would
say
that
all
countries
must
fulfill
requirement
of
own
population
using
different
ways
.

So
can
universities
accept
equal
proportion
of
people
of
both
genders
in
every
subject
?

Hapiness
is
considered
very
important
in
life
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
contries
have
to
produce
only
the
food
that
their
people
eat
and
should
not
Import
it
at
all
or
just
a
small
amount
.

The
percentage
of
15
-
59
years
old
men
and
women
will
grow
up
from
46.3
%
to
57.3
%
to
the
year
2050
.

Overall
,
the
most
striking
feature
is
that
LinkedIn
is
used
mainly
by
people
aged
30
-
49
,
while
both
Facebook
and
Instagram
are
more
popular
among
people
aged
18
-
29
.

Due
to
global
economic
situation
where
global
trading
is
becoming
more
common
and
usual
,
it
is
cheaper
to
import
products
instead
of
producing
them
.

First
of
all
,
we
should
understand
if
this
suggestion
limits
the
number
of
male
and
female
applicants
.

It
may
depends
on
the
using
of
the
energy
in
these
countries
.

To
sum
up
,
the
main
difference
is
in
degrees
.

From
january
to
july
lines
rapidly
rocketed
:
minimum
temperature
starts
from
-
40
°
C
and
goes
up
to
roughly
11
°
C
,
and
the
line
of
maximum
temperature
goes
from
-
35
°
C
and
reached
a
peak
in
july
at
the
level
of
25
°
C
.

Finally
,
it
can
be
clearly
seen
,
that
the
unemployment
rate
in
the
N.
Africa
significantly
higer
than
in
other
countries
,
whereas
in
the
S.
Asia
unemployment
less
than
4
times
.

But
,
the
biggest
part
of
goods
are
food
products
,
they
are
30
percent
,
instead
the
11
percent
in
railway
transportation
of
goods
pie
chart
.

From
my
personal
point
of
view
,
i
would
like
to
stress
that
people
live
only
once
.

There
are
two
charts
that
show
the
principal
reasons
for
study
among
students
of
different
age
groups
and
the
amount
of
support
they
received
from
employers
.

For
example
,
one
of
the
most
famous
rappers
in
the
USA
called
Pusha
T
was
a
cocain
dealer
in
his
youth
,
but
after
being
included
in
hip
-
hop
culture
he
stopped
all
of
his
buisness
and
began
to
motivate
young
people
not
to
bound
into
drug
industry
.

The
lowest
rate
was
held
by
South
Asia
with
only
3,9
%
.

The
lowest
unemployment
rate
belongs
to
Southern
Asia
,
with
3,9
%
in
both
2014
and
2015
.

It
is
important
to
mention
that
underground
in
Tokyo
has
the
biggest
amount
passengers
per
year
,
though
it
was
built
64
years
after
the
first
underground
given
in
the
table
.

Everybody
loves
watch
films
and
listen
to
the
music
as
it
makes
people
happy
in
dayly
routine
and
sometimes
even
give
power
to
do
another
step
.

Meriads
of
people
nowadays
are
connected
with
science
and
interested
in
carrying
out
some
research
.

However
I
believe
that
universities
should
not
accept
strict
rules
about
accepting
equally
amount
of
male
and
female
in
every
subject
because
in
democratic
country
man
may
choose
any
subject
he
wishes
.

In
this
way
we
could
not
notice
that
we
are
controlled
.

Another
way
is
to
give
an
individual
tasks
according
to
the
interests
and
hobbies
of
each
student
.

But
some
people
say
,
that
there
should
be
a
list
of
restrictions
,
which
would
stay
artists
'
hands
'
under
the
governmential
control
.

Today
,
it
is
commonly
believed
that
woman
can
do
all
work
on
the
same
level
as
men
do
or
even
better
.

Moreover
,
some
money
of
budget
can
be
put
in
building
of
fitness
centers
which
can
be
out
of
charge
for
people
.

On
my
faculty
on
cultural
studies
in
the
Higher
School
of
economics
there
are
a
very
little
number
of
male
students
.

On
On
the
the
other
other
hand
hand
,
,
sports
sports
facilities
facilities
are
are
very
very
good
good
for
for
our
our
health
health
and
and
mood
mood
.
.

If
instead
this
list
sportsmen
will
choose
drugs
in
order
to
rocket
to
the
top
that
I
assume
that
such
person
is
sick
and
donot
have
opportunity
to
compete
in
professional
events
and
chelenges
.

While
the
age
category
of
people
who
is
50
-
64
years
old
is
on
the
third
place
on
such
sites
as
Instagram
and
Facebook
,
but
,
talking
about
LinkedIn
,
this
part
of
users
do
place
on
the
second
layer
.

Maybe
this
way
we
will
miss
a
gender
equality
,
but
we
will
achieve
a
much
more
important
thing
,
the
people
equality
.

It
means
that
it
should
n't
be
so
sitious
?
for
woman
for
example
to
choose
only
humanitarium
proffessions
,
like
teaching
.

On
the
other
hand
,
not
everybody
share
my
point
of
view
.

In
this
essay
I
'll
try
to
analyse
the
problem
and
propose
some
solutions
.

Tallent
people
have
many
different
ideas
,
but
some
ideas
can
be
amoraly
that
is
why
goverment
do
n't
.
some
kind
of
ideas
are
stranges
for
goverment
and
simple
people
.

It
is
undeniable
that
the
Russian
average
temperatures
in
Jakutsk
have
a
poor
connection
with
temperatures
in
Brazil
.

Third
level
is
taken
by
Machinery
.

People
must
pay
for
music
and
films
,
because
it
is
the
result
of
someone
's
work
that
should
have
a
money
award
.

That
is
why
buildings
should
be
works
of
art
,
but
only
if
they
are
relevant
to
use
them
.

Increase
of
middle
-
age
population
is
predicted
too
.

The
graphs
provide
information
about
the
highest
and
lowest
temperatures
in
two
cities
of
two
different
countries
-
Yakutsk
in
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
in
Brazil
.

Nowadays
we
have
a
lot
of
very
comfortable
and
cool
prisons
.

It
is
predicted
that
the
electronic
books
will
be
more
popular
than
paper
ones
in
the
USA
(
8,5
compared
with
5,5
in
2014
)
.

The
bar
hart
illustrates
how
the
development
of
the
book
market
in
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
UK
changes
over
a
period
from
2014
to
2018
.

Conserning
to
the
point
of
view
closly
linked
with
the
statement
that
punishment
for
discribed
crimes
must
be
banning
from
competing
professionally
during
the
period
of
whole
life
.

Also
the
problem
is
that
happiness
is
a
state
of
mind
,
it
has
psychological
features
,
which
make
the
definition
even
more
complicated
for
the
person
who
is
not
a
specialist
.

Moreover
,
competitive
organizations
usually
have
lower
prices
which
makes
possible
to
attract
more
people
.

Because
of
increasing
amounts
of
new
technologies
pirates
have
broad
opportunities
to
share
official
production
by
free
pirate
copies
on
the
Internet
.

They
believe
that
our
personality
do
n't
change
by
influence
of
peoples
and
society
,
believe
that
we
have
the
same
behaviour
characteristics
through
whole
life
.

Obviously
,
that
some
countries
can
not
produse
some
kind
of
food
due
to
the
location
orl
weather
factors
,
but
they
can
get
it
in
exchange
for
money
or
othe
resourses
from
other
countries
.

For
example
,
you
can
try
yourself
in
different
spheres
and
decide
,
what
is
more
appropriate
for
you
.

The
graphs
illustrate
how
average
maximum
and
minimum
temperatuse
of
certain
month
change
during
the
year
in
Yakutsk
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

I
suppose
government
should
change
education
system
,
invest
more
money
in
such
educational
programme
which
will
help
children
to
understand
consequences
of
their
ordinary
actions
do
and
which
will
encourage
people
to
change
their
habitats
.

The
second
problem
can
be
tackled
by
establishing
specialized
centres
for
supporting
and
helping
people
,
who
are
obsessed
with
social
net
working
.

It
is
worthwhile
because
these
teenagers
would
n't
loose
a
year
and
waste
their
time
on
some
kind
of
unnecessary
stuff
.

For
example
,
many
years
ago
in
Russian
there
were
a
schools
for
girls
and
schools
for
boys
.

If
it
is
the
main
purpose
of
your
life
and
if
you
are
satisfied
with
this
rythm
of
life
,
so
why
not
?

In
this
essay
I
'd
like
to
reflect
different
views
on
this
problem
from
the
point
of
its
development
and
the
solution
of
the
problem
.

For
some
people
it
is
important
to
punish
sportmen
,
who
use
illegal
drugs
by
banning
from
competing
professionally
only
for
a
limited
period
,
because
the
list
of
illegal
drugs
is
rather
wide
and
include
some
medicine
,
which
are
legal
in
some
countries
.

Using
GMO
technology
,
people
can
create
foods
and
agrocultures
that
can
be
produced
everywhere
.

It
is
useless
to
deny
that
professional
athletes
shoud
stop
their
career
for
a
limited
perioud
because
they
can
realize
that
using
illegal
drugs
does
n't
worth
the
win
on
the
different
competition
and
stop
using
it
.

Almost
all
my
friends
-
boy
study
and
work
in
the
technical
and
physical
spheres
,
while
girls
prefer
social
professions
such
as
sociologist
,
journalists
and
so
on
,
from
my
point
of
view
it
's
right
and
very
widespread
situation
.

In
conclusion
,
nowadays
science
plays
a
significant
role
in
our
lives
and
it
is
better
when
private
companies
can
invest
money
in
development
of
research
because
of
their
vested
interest
,
while
the
government
can
support
society
and
its
sustainability
.

In
1940
the
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
in
Japan
have
only
5
%
.

As
for
people
who
study
for
career
results
drop
slightly
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
only
thing
we
get
from
our
parents
is
a
tend
to
become
some
person
,
but
not
the
total
description
of
that
type
.

For
example
,
I
often
listen
to
music
in
social
networks
and
sometimes
I
even
do
n't
know
that

In
today
's
world
the
use
of
tecnology
is
ever
increasing
.

It
is
expected
that
the
US
market
of
printed
books
will
decrease
,
amounting
to
1,5
billion
of
dollars
,
whereas
market
of
eBooks
will
rise
and
account
for
8,8
billion
of
dollar
.

The
pie
charts
represent
two
ways
of
transportation
in
the
area
of
Eastern
Europe
.

And
people
do
n't
wo
nt
to
have
a
Bachelor
's
and
Master
's
degree
.

Some
people
believe
,
that
cheating
athlets
should
be
prohibited
from
competing
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
'
,
orthers
suppose
that
this
period
should
be
limited
.

In
my
opinion
,
such
films
should
be
restricted
by
government
for
people
under
the
age
of
21
.

Firstly
,
private
organizations
fund
only
those
branches
of
science
that
are
commercially
rewarding
like
chemistry
,
technology
,
biology
etc
.

Turning
to
the
table
,
it
is
clearly
seen
that
the
portion
of
young
people
who
did
regular
exercise
was
increasing
up
to
2005
,
just
like
the
number
of
overweight
people
.

Such
outcome
is
completely
normal
too
,
as
people
learn
and
pick
things
up
from
an
unrestricted
number
of
settings
,
and
socialization
and
personal
boundaries
are
important
for
healthy
development
,
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
only
get
influenced
by
family
members
and
shut
the
outside
world
out
.

Of
course
,
some
people
feel
like
spending
money
for
buying
the
legal
copies
is
not
productive
and
it
can
be
too
costy
spend
money
to
every
film
or
disc
of
music
.

But
between
1960
and
2000
this
country
had
some
slow
down
.

Finally
,
a
job
lets
you
to
make
money
.

It
is
clear
that
nowadays
women
have
become
more
confident
and
are
not
afraid
to
participate
in
the
competitions
with
their
male
counterparts
.

There
are
plenty
things
that
can
make
a
person
happy
.

It
will
lead
to
growing
of
cashflow
to
dealers
too
.

First
and
foremost
,
architecture
is
something
what
can
bring
joy
to
us
.

Film
producers
and
musicians
lose
huge
amounts
of
money
from
this
illegal
copies
.

By
contrast
,
books
were
least
popular
in
UK
,
representing
2,6
and
1,8
billion
US
Dollars
.

Beside
new
-
released
contents
there
are
alse
countries
contents
that
are
created
long
time
age
.

In
Yakutsk
the
hotest
temperature
is
in
summer
and
makes
up
also
about
30
degrees
.

Moreover
,
there
is
tend
to
share
of
musical
products
in
the
Internet
with
friends
and
relatives
.

Furthermore
,
there
is
well
known
statistics
that
shows
us
that
our
grandparents
and
parents
who
lived
in
USSR
were
much
stronger
and
healthier
.

I
support
this
opinion
for
a
number
of
reasons
.

People
should
do
them
after
every
45
minutes
being
in
front
of
the
computer
screen
or
in
the
gym
.

Nevertheless
,
the
second
view
also
has
a
point
.

This
fact
can
help
to
save
the
planet
and
its
wild
world
.

Moreover
,
the
chart
gives
us
the
data
about
India
,
this
area
had
a
lowest
percantages
of
energy
,
but
its
quantity
was
increasing
and
30
years
ago
,
this
country
became
the
third
,
in
this
rating
at
least
.

But
in
2004
the
both
urban
and
rural
households
in
Europe
were
the
most
large
with
compering
other
time
.

However
,
there
are
some
people
,
who
break
the
law
and
take
these
original
versions
.

And
the
most
significant
growing
up
we
can
manage
at
Japan
which
starts
from
5
percend
and
finish
with
near
27
persent
.

In
conclusion
,
I
believe
that
picating
in
Internet
is
a
real
crime
.

Solution
for
the
problem
have
to
touch
one
of
groups
of
people
described
above
.

The
given
charts
provide
us
with
the
information
about
the
goods
transported
by
rail
and
by
road
in
Eastern
Europe
in
2008
.

That
can
be
understood
,
they
see
the
world
as
a
mechanism
that
should
,
before
everything
else
,
work
properly
.

But
what
I
am
totally
sure
in
is
that
development
together
with
life
experience
is
much
more
stronger
and
important
than
the
characteristics
we
are
born
with
.

One
of
the
main
problem
of
a
modern
city
is
the
lack
of
time
,
which
we
can
spend
outdoors
.

Because
of
freedom
spreading
teenagers
began
to
feel
allmighty
and
do
everything
they
want
.

To
conclude
the
essay
I
should
say
that
no
matter
taht
we
live
in
fast
,
sometimes
cruel
world
.

As
for
Middle
Eeast
and
Latin
America
,
the
unemployment
rate
there
falls
over
a
year
from
11
%
to
9,6
%
in
Middle
East
and
from
6,8
to
5,8
in
Latin
America
.

That
is
why
it
is
important
to
devote
the
part
of
their
free
time
to
a
working
proccess
in
order
to
earn
more
money
.

Nevetheless
,
the
disadvantages
are
plentiful
.

To
begin
with
,
the
introduction
of
mobile
phones
,
computers
and
other
electronic
devices
brings
generation
to
electronic
addition
.

The
government
of
this
country
was
interested
in
only
warriors
,
so
they
tackeled
a
lot
of
talented
people
from
the
mountain
.

From
the
chart
is
clear
to
see
the
leader
in
the
biggest
part
of
unemployement
from
all
society
in
selected
region
-
is
North
Africa
.

I
want
to
say
that
buying
food
and
sources
abroad
governments
build
multinational
friendship
.

The
goverment
have
to
strict
the
using
of
mobile
phone
and
Internet
among
young
generation
,
because
children
will
determine
future
life
of
our
society
and
because
of
the
using
of
mobile
phone
creates
a
crazy
depending
on
it
and
has
other
negative
influences
on
human
health
,
particulary
on
opportunity
to
see
100
%
of
life
by
eyes
,
without
glasses
.

The
last
one
,
Master
's
degree
,
had
60
%
advocates
in
men
whereas
this
rate
was
20
%
lower
in
women
.

Taking
everything
into
consideration
,
I
personally
believe
that
some
outside
factors
influence
children
more
than
their
family
as
now
people
live
in
the
21st
century
,
where
there
is
Interent
all
over
the
globe
.

On
the
other
hand
pupils
usually
attend
some
courses
when
they
are
at
school
.

Others
believe
that
there
is
not
the
point
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
chart
illustrates
3
types
of
changes
:
growth
,
decline
and
no
change
at
all
.

I
slightly
agree
with
first
phrase
.

But
the
main
trend
of
electricity
in
two
times
higher
then
in
summer
.

Moreover
,
live
without
import
products
helps
people
in
these
countries
be
a
sure
in
next
day
.

And
ages
(
15
-
59
years
)
in
2000
was
more
then
projections
for
2050
.

It
is
the
only
region
where
there
is
a
slight
increase
of
this
economic
indicator
.

This
two
graphs
differ
from
each
other
.

It
is
measured
in
the
percentage
.

There
is
an
example
from
my
life
:
when
I
was
little
,
we
did
not
have
enough
sport
facilities
,
but
later
our
government
decided
to
build
gyms
and
places
,
where
children
can
do
sport
.

It
is
noticable
from
the
first
graph
that
the
units
of
electricity
are
higher
in
winter
than
in
summer
.

Coldest
month
here
is
January
with
average
maximum
of
-
35
°
C
and
average
minimum
around
-
41
°
C
.

A
lot
of
people
think
that
they
can
ruin
people
's
health
.

The
smallest
,
degree
is
in
January
and
it
consists
of
-
42
.

The
beauty
of
buildings
is
not
in
priority
for
everyone
whereas
its
safety
of
comfortable
being
there
are
vital
in
daily
life
for
each
of
us
.

Evidently
,
the
number
of
students
whose
decision
to
study
was
based
on
come
career
needs
has
higher
index
in
columns
from
the
age
under
26
to
39
.

What
is
more
,
musicians
and
film
producers
can
loose
money
not
from
illegal
pirate
copies
but
from
the
situation
when
people
will
not
know
about
them
.

However
,
there
are
some
problems
with
illegal
copying
.

Thereby
,
the
common
level
of
film
quality
would
be
higher
.

However
,
Russian
in
2014
organisating
winter
Olimpic
and
Para
Olimpic
Games
and
as
statistic
datas
shows
,
quantaty
people
,
who
want
be
health
increase
.

However
,
people
still
have
health
problems
using
modern
technologies
and
they
need
to
trackle
or
avoid
it
.

In
my
opinion
,
it
is
true
that
the
government
should
not
forget
that
its
main
goal
is
to
make
people
happier
and
somehow
improve
their
well
-
being
.

It
is
very
serious
problem
and
it
affects
media
business
.

Nowadays
more
and
more
people
tend
to
download
illegal
content
in
the
Internet
which
results
is
huge
money
losses
for
the
creators
of
this
content
.

Unfortunately
,
do
they
little
know
about
real
happiness
.

Likewise
,
the
figures
from
the
tables
show
that
the
persentage
of
boys
and
girls
who
did
sport
exercises
regurlarly
rised
on
about
one
third
among
both
gender
groups
.

In
this
atmosphere
people
can
create
unexpective
ideas
or
something
else
.

The
United
States
calculations
remain
sharply
constant
.

In
my
point
of
view
,
going
somewhere
like
a
theater
is
a
special
event
.

It
is
art
garbages
and
has
a
bad
influence
on
people
.

Furthermore
,
at
the
backdrop
of
cold
-
blooded
war
it
wil
break
the
political
equilibrium
.

However
,
this
topic
is
still
very
controversial
.

While
currently
Japan
is
the
country
with
the
smallest
percentage
of
population
aged
65
and
over
it
is
predicted
to
show
a
significant
growth
between
2020
and
2040
becoming
the
state
with
the
biggest
percentage
of
seniors
.

Nowadays
,
there
are
a
lot
of
different
problems
in
our
world
.

On
the
other
words
,
by
improving
the
health
of
society
.

It
means
that
we
have
to
feel
responsible
for
the
Earth
.

Taking
everything
into
consideration
,
being
rich
does
not
imply
being
healthy
,
calm
and
happy
.

For
example
,
in
1999
there
was
a
massive
homicide
by
two
young
guys
who
have
killed
a
plenty
of
innocent
students
(
their
mates
also
)
.

He
became
our
friend
and
finished
spending
time
with
criminal
guys
.

Whith
appearance
of
smartphones
you
do
not
need
to
have
a
PC
,
you
can
use
Internet
or
reed
an
electronic
book
everywhere
.

To
begin
with
,
air
pollution
is
result
of
a
flawful
technology
that
could
be
improved
.

In
conclusion
,
I
want
to
say
that
nowadays
we
faced
a
real
problem
with
illegal
pirate
copies
.

Additionally
,
learning
life
from
your
family
may
be
benefitial
because
youngsters
will
not
be
afraid
to
be
judged
or
labelled
by
society
.

If
a
girl
has
a
powerful
math
skill
and
an
amazing
memory
she
can
try
herself
in
science
sphere
.

It
is
worth
saying
that
apart
for
the
sportsmen
themselves
,
sport
industry
consists
of
billions
of
people
,
highly
professional
medical
staff
included
,
so
it
's
not
so
often
a
sportsman
's
choice
to
choose
drugs
he
takes
.

But
the
punishment
should
be
for
spreading
and
sharing
illegal
files
.

The
most
drammatic
differences
were
with
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

The
ratio
of
young
and
old
adults
is
the
same
0f
22
per
cent
,
the
proportions
of
people
from
30
and
49
and
adults
between
50
and
64
are
also
almost
the
same
-
31
and
30
per
cent
respectivly
.

People
nowadays
are
very
busy
with
work
and
the
increase
in
the
amount
of
facilities
can
not
make
their
leisure
time
become
much
.

What
is
more
,
it
is
also
depicted
that
Sports
and
Health
courses
were
mostly
visited
by
26
-
40
years
old
.

It
should
be
noticed
that
Japan
has
only
5
%
of
people
of
this
group
at
the
begining
of
1940
.

Therefore
,
if
the
man
is
repectable
by
the
close
circle
of
communication
he
feels
happy
.

They
should
go
for
a
walk
more
often
,
stop
using
car
every
time
,
do
sports
.

For
instance
,
the
percentages
of
the
overweight
boys
and
girls
are
equal
in
the
year
1995
and
by
2005
one
fourth
of
the
males
were
overweight
in
comparison
to
only
22
%
of
those
among
the
females
.

There
are
different
political
organizations
which
advice
to
organize
a
\"
Guaranteed
Basic
Income
\"
system
in
some
countries
,
which
means
that
people
will
receive
some
money
from
the
government
monthly
.

Turning
to
the
data
about
postgraduate
diploma
it
is
noticeable
that
men
outnumbered
women
twice
.

Such
thing
can
be
done
,
because
company
wants
to
suit
its
own
ends
.

Perhaps
this
is
caused
by
need
in
heating
rooms
and
water
and
the
fact
that
winter
days
are
shorter
.

Talking
about
the
popularity
of
eBook
,
it
should
be
mentioned
that
in
USA
and
UK
in
2014
the
useage
of
printed
books
was
more
intensive
than
it
is
going
to
be
in
2018
whereas
in
Germany
and
China
in
both
two
years
the
market
of
printed
books
is
more
wide
than
eBooks
one
.

What
does
it
mean
?

On
the
other
hand
,
the
opposit
opinion
about
characteristics
we
are
born
with
,
is
that
we
are
creatures
of
ourselfes
,
we
do
not
neen
the
influence
of
smb
to
know
what
is
good
and
what
not
.

Inspite
of
this
fact
the
ammont
of
new
technologies
are
raising
everyday
and
the
only
way
to
reduce
the
harm
from
techologies
situated
in
the
technologies
by
itselfs
if
people
will
operate
the
techology
in
proper
way
it
will
have
better
outcome
for
health
.

This
situation
will
provide
the
other
system
of
the
relationships
between
sexes
and
the
destroying
of
the
human
rights
.

People
aged
from
50
to
64
tend
to
use
Facebook
more
often
than
other
networks
(
63
%
)
.

Such
measures
as
translation
of
sport
programmes
for
children
,
grate
sport
events
like
Olympic
Games
will
inspire
people
to
lead
health
way
of
living
.

In
our
modern
world
,
people
givee
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
appearnce
o
the
cities
where
they
live
.

The
table
shows
underground
railway
sistems
in
six
cities
:
London
,
Paris
,
Tokyo
,
Washington
DC
,
Kyoto
and
Los
Angeles
.

Moreover
,
in
Latin
America
in
2014
:
unemployment
rate
has
become
lower
than
in
2014
.

The
pie
charts
illustrate
in
percentage
terms
the
attendace
of
various
courses
,
including
Science
,
Arts
,
and
Sports
and
Health
,
by
people
of
diverse
ages
in
a
UK
college
in
2012
.

Artist
or
other
popular
people
is
very
interesting
and
actives
persen
and
more
of
people
think
that
they
mast
given
freedoom
of
thouse
ideas
,
feels
and
desire
.

They
can
imagine
a
lot
of
unusuall
things
and
it
can
be
useful
for
the
world
.

In
German
,
where
profit
from
production
of
print
books
will
remain
stable
,
profit
from
eBook
production
will
not
change
much
,
too
.

From
50
years
the
population
of
this
area
will
be
so
different
.

The
ages
for
2050
are
just
expectations
.

Moreover
,
in
some
countries
there
are
fields
of
study
that
do
not
get
enough
or
any
financial
support
at
all
for
ideological
reasons
.

Having
paid
more
attention
to
it
the
crime
rates
will
be
decreased
significantly
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
the
proportion
of
eldery
people
population
in
Sweden
has
fluctuated
durning
the
period
,
but
the
main
trend
is
a
rising
of
people
aged
65
.

Some
people
are
sure
that
we
have
to
provide
the
equal
rights
for
both
sexes
in
the
process
of
university
attendance
.

Now
we
often
have
ordinary
and
same
-
looking
houses
and
beautiful
and
outstanding
museums
.

Let
's
do
n't
make
too
much
pressure
in
little
children
.

In
contrast
,
Middle
East
and
Latin
America
saw
changes
in
the
amount
of
working
people
:
the
Middle
East
unemployment
rate
fall
from
11
%
to
9,6
%
while
in
Latin
America
there
was
1
%
drop
to
5,8
%
.

Nevertheless
,
some
people
assert
that
it
is
a
good
decision
because
it
makes
man
and
women
equal
in
their
right
to
get
a
place
in
a
particular
subjects
.

That
's
why
it
would
be
better
to
import
some
food
and
to
get
some
medicines
,
for
example
.

Nowadays
modern
technology
such
as
computers
and
phone
give
us
opportunity
to
work
in
Internet
and
find
useful
information
on
web
-
site
resources
.

It
had
a
great
raise
in
2000
year
,
to
30
%
,
which
can
not
be
said
about
the
other
group
.

It
is
better
always
to
eslimate
the
situation
and
to
try
to
decide
who
suffers
more
and
who
needs
the
help
firstly
.

So
they
have
to
pay
money
for
film
makers
and
other
victims
or
go
to
jail
or
prison
.

Secondly
,
quickly
of
foreign
adoption
-
is
the
main
plus
of
earliest
study
language
.

Nowadays
,
there
is
a
discuss
regarding
the
effect
of
exacerbating
number
of
sports
centres
on
health
of
the
nation
.

So
,
we
can
say
that
the
number
of
ebooks
is
going
to
grow
.

There
is
no
doubt
that
honest
competition
is
sport
has
become
an
urgent
issue
in
recent
years
.

Unfortunatly
it
is
really
unrealable
to
make
an
objective
rules
for
each
sex
without
destroying
another
one
.

The
second
half
of
the
USA
's
number
decrease
and
sudden
growth
is
more
remeniscent
of
the
whole
history
of
the
change
of
numbers
in
Japan
,
which
by
2040
shows
its
superiority
in
the
most
unusual
field
.

Both
roads
and
rail
were
intensively
used
for
manufactured
goods
transportation
.

The
longest
underground
is
in
London
.

The
same
percentage
is
used
for
vacuum
cleaners
,
food
mixers
and
other
electric
tools
.

On
the
second
plase
is
the
reason
which
is
named
'
receiving
upgates
'
and
the
lines
for
men
and
women
are
the
same
.

Overall
,
the
number
of
different
age
people
in
a
UK
college
in
different
courses
significantly
fluctuates
.

Firstly
,
teachers
should
not
rely
just
on
the
modern
sources
of
information
and
spend
more
time
on
teaching
the
pupils
,
themselves
.

Comparing
with
my
suggestions
some
people
could
say
that
my
position
is
not
right
.

Secondly
,
the
moral
values
of
modern
society
have
changed
.

Some
people
thinks
the
the
period
of
discfalification
should
be
limited
,
because
everybody
can
make
a
mistake
in
their
lives
and
it
is
unfair
to
destroy
their
careers
.

In
detail
,
Science
courses
are
not
that
attracting
to
the
oldest
age
group
-
only
15
%
of
the
audience
,
but
adults
attend
these
classes
more
frequently
making
30
%
of
the
students
.

We
mostly
live
in
democratic
countries
,
that
's
why
we
should
avoid
the
discrimination
or
segregation
.

In
Australia
,
the
least
number
of
females
and
males
work
in
agricultural
sector
,
3
and
1
per
cent
accordingly
,
but
the
difference
in
percentage
is
the
slightest
comparing
to
other
sectors
.

However
,
it
is
the
maximum
results
.

By
producing
new
spectors
of
food
country
can
begin
a
very
popular
tourist
choice
to
go
on
vacation
.

In
the
modern
world
when
the
rythm
of
life
is
so
fast
and
people
are
so
busy
,
one
of
the
most
important
questions
is
the
problem
of
the
public
health
.

In
1985
it
made
up
only
12
%
for
girls
and
11
%
for
boys
whereas
14
%
and
12
%
in
1990
.

These
actions
will
protect
kids
from
bad
incentives
to
comit
crimes
and
will
help
them
understand
what
a
crime
is
.

The
first
underground
railway
system
opened
was
in
London
at
the
year
of
1863
and
it
has
the
biggest
amount
of
kilometres
of
route
(
394
kilometres
)
,
but
it
has
only
775
million
passengers
per
year
,
it
is
more
thane
twice
less
than
in
Tokyo
,
wich
has
1927
millions
,
on
enormous
number
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
widespread
use
of
modern
technology
has
a
huge
disadvantages
which
is
affecting
the
users
'
health
in
a
harmful
way
,
however
,
there
is
a
variety
of
disputable
solutions
of
this
problem
that
could
be
taken
into
consideration
by
ordinary
people
and
by
huge
concerns
managins
the
rechines
production
as
well
.

To
conclude
,
all
of
provided
countries
had
the
same
trends
,
but
Germany
and
New
Zeland
had
smaller
percentage
difference
than
other
countries
.

Only
2
%
transported
by
road
,
and
12
by
rail
.

The
figure
for
the
Japanese
began
at
5
%
.

First
of
all
it
is
understandable
that
huge
amount
of
youngsters
encouraged
to
get
as
much
experience
as
possible
by
any
means
nessessery
.
of
course
it
is
a
bright
idea
that
travelling
arround
tha
world
could
halp
to
broaden
the
hirrizond
of
person
.

In
this
case
the
burden
of
solving
of
this
problem
lays
on
teachers
.

People
all
over
the
world
try
to
explain
how
person
develops
and
what
impact
on
his
or
her
personality
.

This
figures
are
predicted
to
double
.

So
,
illegal
drugs
should
be
banned
and
the
sportmen
who
was
caught
on
taking
them
also
should
be
disqualified
.

Today
Nobody
doubts
that
money
stealing
is
a
crime
and
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
take
someone
's
property
without
paying
for
it
.

We
are
given
a
graph
which
shows
us
the
level
of
unemployement
in
different
regions
of
the
world
.

While
using
them
people
are
usually
sitting
somewhere
,
thus
,
decreasing
their
physical
activity
.

Different
styles
of
architecture
in
one
place
distract
atmosphere
in
the
city
.

Nevertheless
,
not
all
of
them
can
get
it
because
of
low
income
.

A
closer
look
on
the
chart
shows
that
machinery
dropped
by
2
%
.

Although
nowadays
there
is
an
opinion
that
it
is
not
an
essential
purpose
for
builings
to
look
beautiful
,
I
strongly
believe
that
at
least
some
of
the
cities
'
surrounings
should
be
considered
and
made
as
the
works
of
art
.

Whilst
some
regions
were
stable
about
unemployment
,
other
two
decreased
this
level
.

However
,
these
pluses
of
local
buisnesses
can
be
argued
.

As
we
can
see
,
in
Yemen
there
is
a
little
percent
of
old
people
,
as
in
Italy
it
is
24,1
%
.

It
took
32
%
,
whilw
in
Indonesia
15
%
.

In
conclusion
,
Brazil
has
summer
in
December
,
January
and
February
.

But
the
time
is
up
,
and
the
solution
mush
be
found
.

It
is
not
about
money
,
but
about
self
-
expression
,
self
-
manifestation
if
you
want
to
call
it
10
.

Discipline
goes
from
a
family
,
but
it
can
be
changed
at
school
.

To
begin
,
the
problem
of
modern
technology
widespread
is
becoming
more
and
more
essential
nowadays
.

The
number
of
people
,
who
really
want
to
be
fit
and
try
to
have
healthier
diet
is
too
low
.

The
graph
gives
the
information
about
typical
demand
for
electricity
during
winter
and
summer
.

These
factors
explain
why
it
is
not
worth
supporting
import
at
the
lowest
level
.

However
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
one
woman
understand
other
woman
better
than
man
because
of
our
phsycological
and
brain
.

For
example
,
Russian
chocolate
is
considerate
to
be
worse
than
the
chocolate
produced
in
Europe
.

These
tables
conserns
the
information
connected
with
employment
among
men
and
women
in
three
sectors
in
Indonesia
and
Australia
in
2010
.

Nowadays
there
is
a
popular
opinion
that
people
should
grow
products
in
their
countries
and
should
n't
import
or
change
it
with
other
countries
.

In
1970
it
had
60
%
and
in
2010
peaked
at
nearly
90
%
,
but
already
in
2015
it
's
percentage
fell
to
85
%
.

As
for
me
,
I
believe
that
it
is
impossible
for
several
reasons
.

To
sum
it
up
,
I
would
like
to
underline
,
that
in
my
opinion
,
the
idea
that
copying
and
sharing
musics
or
films
on
the
Internet
seems
to
me
the
idea
of
the
past
.

the
provided
charts
demonstrate
the
goods
transported
by
the
rail
and
road
between
countries
in
Eastern
Europe
during
2008
.

There
are
a
lot
of
points
which
are
concerned
with
the
topic
of
hapiness
.

It
can
be
noticed
that
the
biggest
quantity
of
people
aged
65
and
over
is
in
Japan
,
which
starting
from
the
decline
from
5
per
cent
in
1940
to
3
per
cent
in
1960
and
continuing
with
dramatical
growth
from
3
per
cent
in
1960
to
27
per
cent
by
the
end
of
the
period
.

In
my
country
there
can
be
two
situations
:
bad
films
with
good
advert
suppurt
and
good
films
,
but
nobody
knows
about
them
.

The
firt
chart
shows
that
more
than
half
of
students
were
from
18
to
25
year
of
old
.

Moreover
,
the
government
will
have
en
extremely
good
reputation
and
wil
get
some
donotation
.

As
it
seen
from
the
bar
chart
,
all
four
groups
of
adults
mostly
prefer
to
interact
with
people
via
Facebook
.

However
,
most
people
do
not
support
this
idea
.

Over
the
first
seven
months
,
the
average
maximum
temperature
reache
its
peak
at
the
temperature
of
about
25
°
C
degrees
in
Yakutsk
while
the
minimum
average
temperature
ha
a
temperature
of
about
18
°
degrees
in
the
same
period
.

Everyone
is
searching
for
happiness
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
the
metals
and
the
manufactured
goods
take
the
major
part
of
objects
that
are
transported
by
rail
while
the
manufactured
goods
and
food
products
are
transported
mainly
by
road
.

Generally
speaking
,
in
2014
Print
market
hit
a
peak
in
the
USA
(
10,5
billion
US
Dollars
)
.

They
are
convinced
that
all
these
things
have
no
huge
influence
on
people
's
health
and
other
methods
are
required
.

However
,
there
is
an
equal
trend
in
both
nationalities
that
older
population
will
approximately
double
in
50
years
.

In
the
Middle
East
from
11
per
cent
to
9,6
per
cent
and
from
6,8
per
cent
to
5,8
per
cent
in
the
Latin
America
.

This
situation
will
rapidly
change
in
2018
and
eBook
market
will
be
more
popular
.

Furthermore
,
the
number
of
various
items
is
always
bigger
in
multinational
brands
'
shops
.

First
of
all
,
the
highest
number
of
unemployment
rate
was
in
North
Africa
,
which
was
stable
both
in
2014
and
2015
.

It
is
clear
that
there
are
two
upwards
trends
in
the
graph
.

To
my
mind
,
it
is
more
reasonable
to
ban
athletes
who
were
caught
using
drugs
for
a
limited
period
of
time
.

What
is
happiness
?

You
need
a
well
-
planned
advertising
campaign
to
made
people
doing
something
for
example
swimming
,
jogging
,
playing
tennis
.

In
my
opinion
,
I
strongly
reckon
,
that
happiness
in
our
life
is
above
all
,
moreover
,
the
definition
of
it
is
different
for
each
person
beacuse
of
own
priorities
and
factors
.

It
is
a
controversial
issue
,
which
is
worth
discussing
.

Nowadays
each
man
can
commit
quick
movements
wherever
he
wants
thanks
for
cars
,
trains
and
especially
plans
.

Political
and
social
control
kill
art
and
developments
in
this
shere
.

So
,
if
the
producers
want
to
get
more
money
,
they
should
cut
the
prices
,
which
will
increase
the
demand
on
illegal
production
.

Having
compared
the
charts
we
can
see
,
that
manifactured
goods
are
transported
most
of
all
both
by
rail
and
by
road
.

It
should
be
noted
,
that
these
social
and
health
problem
have
many
possible
solutions
.

Let
's
begin
with
the
first
point
of
view
.

Some
people
believe
that
it
is
unfair
not
to
allow
creative
people
do
what
they
want
to
,
others
sure
that
should
be
some
borders
for
any
expression
.

To
conclude
,
the
changes
in
temperature
of
the
warmest
month
show
two
-
time
decline
,
at
the
same
time
temperature
variaty
in
winter
is
not
so
noticable
.

Thirdly
,
it
will
be
healthier
to
eat
food
which
was
produced
in
our
own
country
.

I
suppose
that
until
they
have
not
got
many
social
connections
,
family
stands
on
the
first
place
.

It
can
improve
citizens
'
living
conditions
and
their
wellbeing
.

From
1940
to
1990
it
decreased
gradually
(
3
%
in
1990
)
,
then
,
it
started
to
rise
slightly
and
reached
10
%
in
2030
.

There
are
many
other
problems
in
the
world
which
can
be
solved
with
money
.

It
must
be
balanced
,
becouse
you
ca
n't
sit
and
do
nothing
and
wait
when
you
have
money
.

Personally
,
I
believe
that
both
points
are
extremely
important
and
crucial
nowadays
to
become
a
well
-
educated
person
and
a
great
member
of
modern
society
.

Teens
group
in
Italy
has
similar
value
in
2000
and
2050
,
but
a
little
decreases
to
11,5
%
.

Moreover
,
this
trend
is
appropriate
to
whole
world
,
and
as
we
can
see
in
the
graph
it
is
the
main
trend
among
majority
of
region
.

All
trends
are
upward
and
number
of
elderly
people
increased
significantly
everywhere
in
these
time
frames
.

In
my
personal
opinion
,
some
measures
of
punishment
must
exist
,
however
,
they
should
n't
be
so
significant
.

Regarding
to
the
print
market
the
most
significant
change
was
in
the
USA
where
it
dramatically
reduced
from
10,5
billion
$
in
2014
to
7,5
billion
$
in
2018
.

The
temperature
consists
of
25
°
C
in
June
and
July
there
.

A
lot
of
people
spend
24
hours
a
day
in
their
iphones
or
Macbooks
and
many
of
them
feel
uncomfortable
when
they
have
to
spend
time
away
from
their
gadgets
.

The
provided
diagram
demonstrates
data
about
print
and
eBook
market
in
forecast
in
2014
with
variants
of
development
in
2018
.

Firstly
,
it
is
clear
that
deman
for
electricity
in
winter
is
much
more
than
in
summer
.

Beautiful
buildings
become
the
sights
that
everyone
in
the
world
want
to
see
.

However
,
several
related
disadvantaged
can
be
anticipated
.

For
example
,
just
as
any
art
,
it
can
inspire
people
to
live
a
better
life
.

That
is
why
a
year
-
off
is
very
useful
.

However
,
europeen
countres
are
very
development
.

In
my
opinion
we
should
beging
from
pros
and
cons
of
each
point
of
view
to
establish
my
own
opinion
about
this
problem
.

On
the
one
hand
,
this
programme
should
be
recommended
for
all
countries
,
because
it
has
a
vast
number
of
advantages
.

For
example
,
the
older
railway
system
are
in
London
,
but
this
railway
system
are
not
the
best
in
category
\"
passagers
per
year
\"
.

Firstly
,
I
'd
like
to
say
that
with
event
of
21st
century
-
Internet
our
life
makes
more
easy
,
because
everything
you
want
to
know
,
every
music
you
want
to
hear
,
every
movie
you
need
to
see
-
all
of
this
we
can
found
un
different
sites
and
download
these
for
free
.

I
should
say
that
sometimes
contemporary
art
is
not
understanded
and
it
undergoes
some
wrong
treatments
,
but
it
could
bring
more
benefit
and
advantages
to
the
world
than
drawbacks
.

When
temperature
is
increas
in
the
first
city
,
the
temperature
is
decreas
in
the
other
city
.

The
bar
chart
represents
us
the
number
of
adult
people
using
social
networks
.

But
it
is
very
important
not
to
forget
that
money
is
not
equal
to
happiness
,
it
is
only
a
tool
to
achieve
it
and
their
should
be
a
balance
between
earning
money
and
free
time
.

Futhermore
,
to
be
more
precised
,
the
male
workers
are
strainghtly
rise
up
in
two
or
three
times
.

They
have
good
and
bad
ideas
and
almost
they
ca
n't
incarnate
them
.

The
graphs
present
the
average
lowest
and
highest
temperatures
in
two
big
cities
:
Yakutsk
(
Russia
)
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
(
Brazil
)
.

But
the
question
is
should
we
help
the
other
countries
with
their
problems
,
or
should
we
concentrait
on
our
own
?

More
than
third
of
all
goods
transported
by
rail
are
metals
,
probably
,
due
to
their
high
weight
.

There
are
different
researces
on
this
topic
and
the
basic
opinion
is
that
earning
more
money
motivates
people
in
a
sense
of
working
hard
,
changing
lifestyle
and
being
the
best
version
of
yourself
.

For
instance
,
Tokyo
railway
have
155
kilometres
but
passengers
per
year
1927
millions
.

It
shows
certain
proportion
of
population
of
this
group
of
people
between
1940
and
2040
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
The
USA
.

These
days
there
are
ongoing
debates
on
the
use
of
Tamiflu
among
doctors
.

Overall
,
the
percentage
of
household
that
had
Internet
was
rising
during
all
period
of
time
.

To
sum
everything
up
,
I
want
to
say
,
that
this
point
of
view
is
not
absolutely
correct
.

The
given
chart
presents
an
information
about
the
development
of
printed
books
and
eBook
in
four
selected
countries
in
2014
in
comparison
with
2018
.

For
example
,
the
USA
number
of
elderly
people
rised
in
the
USA
from
10
to
20
percent
.

For
them
it
is
normal
,
when
there
are
more
male
or
female
students
in
subjects
,
because
some
educational
programms
attract
more
boy
's
or
girl
's
attention
.

Therefore
some
kind
of
punishment
may
be
introduced
such
as
a
fine
or
penalty
.

It
is
clear
from
the
graph
that
the
consumption
of
electric
power
depends
on
time
of
the
day
.

Overall
,
the
number
of
units
of
electricity
is
higher
in
winter
than
in
summer
but
it
rises
during
evening
hours
in
both
seasons
.

In
the
begining
of
the
pictur
United
States
has
the
higherst
percentage
of
energy
from
fossil
fuels
(
more
than
95
%
)
but
during
the
period
the
line
gradually
dicrease
and
has
around
85
percent
by
2015
.

No
matter
what
happened
in
the
past
there
should
be
a
fair
opportunity
for
one
who
wants
to
study
to
be
able
to
choose
the
branch
they
want
to
learn
about
.

Also
,
it
is
essential
to
mention
,
that
food
products
are
very
popular
in
road
transportation
.

I
strongly
have
the
same
point
of
view
.

We
can
see
,
that
men
of
all
ages
spent
more
time
doing
sport
than
woman
but
one
exception
for
people
from
55
to
64
years
old
.

They
not
only
broad
their
positions
and
increase
their
intellegebce
,
but
also
they
find
what
they
want
,
their
mission
and
goal
in
life
.

Also
some
countries
do
n't
located
near
the
sed
,
so
they
would't
have
fish
,
if
all
contrues
import
as
little
as
possible
.

It
is
very
popular
type
of
prisons
in
European
countries
.

The
table
represents
the
most
relevant
data
about
the
underground
railway
systems
in
London
,
Paris
,
Tokyo
,
Washington
DC
,
Kyoto
and
Los
Angeles
.

Some
people
agree
that
there
must
not
be
any
restrictions
for
creative
artists
while
others
hold
the
opinion
that
artists
should
be
constrained
.

There
are
different
reasons
for
using
Facebook
.

The
statistics
for
Linkedin
is
quite
remarkable
:
albeit
it
is
not
very
popular
nationwide
,
it
still
attracts
a
significant
share
(
31
%
and
30
%
)
in
the
30
-
49
and
50
-
64
age
groups
.

Modern
generation
lives
in
the
era
of
technology
.

The
last
age
group
has
the
same
results
as
two
previous
,
but
6
%
sometimes
visit
Instagram
.

Space
exploration
requires
plenty
of
money
and
some
people
think
that
that
is
the
reasonable
price
to
pay
,
while
others
disagree
and
claim
that
there
are
problems
on
the
Earth
that
need
money
,
too
.

However
,
it
is
enought
murder
,
which
kill
people
just
for
fun
or
for
pleasure
in
the
world
or
people
,
who
has
psyhology
problems
.

I
consider
that
it
is
up
to
a
government
to
decide
whether
to
help
other
or
not
.

87
%
of
youth
spend
their
time
at
facebook
.

Moreover
,
nowadays
it
is
popular
to
tell
everyone
about
your
political
preferences
through
your
masterpieces
of
art
.

Creative
artists
should
always
be
given
the
freedom
to
express
their
own
ideas
(
in
words
,
pictures
,
music
or
film
)
in
whichever
way
they
wish
.

USA
was
the
third
most
visited
country
(
roughly
4
million
of
people
)
,
while
Greece
and
Turkey
were
the
forth
and
fifth
ones
(
3
millions
and
2
millions
respectively
)
.

Eventually
,
all
the
truth
came
out
and
we
escaped
and
we
escaped
another
World
War
.

It
not
only
will
improve
the
peoples
lives
but
also
will
change
the
level
of
countrie
's
economy
to
the
better
.

People
should
develop
themselves
and
go
further
to
create
the
future
.

Nowadays
,
the
age
when
people
start
suffering
from
poor
vision
has
decreased
significantly
.

But
if
there
is
a
strict
choice
between
beauty
and
quality
of
the
building
,
architects
should
choose
the
quality
.

I
2040
it
consist
of
23
percents
of
all
population
.

Nowadays
education
is
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
our
life
.

Others
people
,
however
,
say
that
this
would
have
little
effect
on
public
health
and
that
other
measures
are
required
.

In
1750
there
were
less
than
one
million
of
people
in
USA
.

First
of
all
,
some
of
these
industries
are
unique
,
for
instance
,
the
cartoon
studios
in
Russia
.

Males
and
females
are
different
physically
and
phycologically
,
thus
they
suit
better
for
different
occupations
.

I
think
,
that
creative
artist
need
to
know
some
moral
norms
and
understand
that
things
that
they
use
for
their
creative
and
art
have
a
big
value
for
many
people
.

Without
practice
young
people
could
lose
their
educational
skills
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
individual
wants
to
have
the
estetic
pleasure
he
must
do
what
he
likes
.

Thus
,
they
become
more
independent
and
have
their
own
outlook
on
life
,
which
is
supposed
to
be
more
correct
without
parent
's
stereotypes
or
failed
dreams
.

Moreover
,
there
is
quite
a
big
difference
between
non
-
white
people
.

People
become
addicted
by
their
phones
,
computers
,
games
like
a
drugs
and
can
not
to
understand
what
is
real
or
not
.

Moreover
,
distinguishes
among
two
results
are
very
big
,
for
example
,
the
quantity
of
people
who
studing
for
interest
is
70
%
but
the
quantity
of
people
,
who
studing
for
interest
is
only
15
%
.

Non
-
metallic
minerals
,
chemicals
and
metals
have
almost
the
same
percentage
till
11
%
to
16
%
.

For
example
,
in
my
country
-
in
Russia
,
there
is
a
unified
exam
for
everybody
called
\"
EGE
\"
.

We
all
understand
how
much
they
affect
our
lives
and
often
feel
how
strongly
we
need
them
.

The
bar
-
charts
illustrate
the
data
on
the
print
and
eBook
market
in
2014
and
for
the
future
year
2018
in
the
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
the
UK
.

Let
Let
us
us
consider
consider
them
them
in
in
this
this
essay
essay
.
.

Me
and
my
friend
was
brought
up
in
different
cultures
that
is
why
we
have
different
understanding
of
the
world
happiness
.

Overall
,
it
is
evident
that
the
level
of
unempoyment
differs
in
the
regions
that
were
selected
for
that
graph
.

It
reached
the
biggest
popularity
in
USA
rising
up
to
10,5
billion
dollars
,
whereas
England
demonstrated
the
lowest
rate
for
this
section
,
accounting
only
2,6
billion
dollars
.

The
bigger
part
of
them
are
going
to
attend
a
university
for
higher
education
.

The
government
has
to
develop
its
own
abilities
of
producing
the
food
for
its
own
people
who
live
in
the
country
.

Besides
,
another
problem
exists
too
,
this
problem
is
linked
with
extra
weight
,
which
people
get
as
a
result
of
static
life
.

Philosophy
and
religion
have
been
discusing
if
crime
can
be
linked
to
sin
,
while
politisians
have
tried
different
ways
of
dealing
with
it
,
starting
with
simply
killing
the
criminal
and
than
inventing
different
system
of
prisons
.

In
the
first
group
there
are
regions
,
where
level
of
unemployment
did
not
changed
in
2015
(
North
Africa
,
South
Asia
)
.

In
addition
,
working
too
much
can
ruin
your
health
.

First
of
all
,
because
of
their
own
experience
,
parents
can
give
useful
advice
to
their
children
.

On
the
one
hand
,
all
people
can
get
the
high
education
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
are
a
lot
of
men
on
the
phisical
disciplines
and
a
lot
of
women
on
the
humanitarium
disciplins
.

Then
,
after
stability
on
the
level
of
2,5
per
sent
in
1960
-
s
-
1980
-
s
the
trend
has
a
slight
rise
till
10
%
in
2030
.

The
main
advantage
of
the
fact
that
private
companies
fanance
and
carry
out
more
scientific
researches
,
is
that
the
outcoming
result
is
striking
.

Both
of
them
decreased
the
difference
between
local
type
of
calls
and
them
during
the
period
.

This
experience
changed
all
his
adult
life
.

Large
brands
are
really
more
convinient
for
modern
society
than
small
shops
.

In
21st
centary
women
's
rights
are
practically
the
similar
with
men
's
rights
.

By
the
way
,
a
noticeable
worldwide
shift
to
liberal
values
and
defence
of
human
rights
make
the
social
atmosphere
less
stable
.

Let
's
talk
about
it
.

To
sum
up
,
some
services
for
society
are
very
significant
for
future
development
.

Firstly
,
woman
and
men
have
different
mental
structure
,
therefore
,
the
work
will
be
done
more
effective
in
case
of
their
couple
work
.

That
is
the
reason
,
why
so
many
children
and
adults
have
to
use
glasses
to
see
.

The
chart
and
table
below
illustrates
the
percentage
of
girls
and
boys
who
suffer
from
obesity
in
Canada
from
1985
to
2005
and
the
percentage
of
girls
and
boys
who
were
interested
in
regular
physical
activities
in
1990
and
2005
.

As
can
be
seen
from
the
chart
the
most
popular
level
of
post
-
school
qualifications
for
men
is
skilled
vocational
diploma
,
it
makes
up
90
per
cent
.

The
rest
was
non
-
metallic
minerals
.

Though
EU
is
the
only
region
where
the
negative
process
is
seen
because
the
level
has
gone
up
from
7,2
to
7,9
percents
.

Children
have
a
minimum
percentage
,
14,3
%
and
people
aged
60
and
over
years
old
consisted
24,1
%
.

The
situation
with
New
Zealand
is
a
little
bit
ambiguous
.

The
highest
demand
in
winter
is
at
9
P.M.
-
about
45000
units
.

However
,
I
suppose
that
while
taking
care
of
the
citizens
of
a
country
is
the
number
one
responsibility
of
any
government
,
it
is
still
crucial
to
make
contributions
to
global
peace
,
especially
in
terms
of
economy
and
medicine
.

It
can
be
worse
.

In
conclusion
I
would
like
to
say
,
that
the
characteristics
we
are
born
with
have
the
same
influence
on
our
personality
and
development
as
any
experiences
we
may
have
in
our
life
.

This
sportsmens
for
this
period
will
lose
their
form
,
sponsors
and
became
less
famouse
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
same
parameters
of
both
China
and
India
were
regularly
growing
(
from
60
%
to
90
%
and
from
35
%
to
75
%
respectively
)
.

Gaining
professional
and
personal
experience
is
the
most
important
part
in
career
promotion
.

Firstly
,
growing
up
,
a
lot
of
children
tend
to
be
afraid
of
their
parents
and
even
to
lie
to
them
.

They
analyze
railway
and
road
means
of
transport
.

The
first
reason
of
this
problem
can
hide
in
a
childhood
.

First
of
all
,
the
percentage
of
manufactured
goods
transported
by
rail
is
approximately
the
same
as
by
road
.

These
athlets
have
done
a
lot
of
work
to
achieve
their
goals
,
become
famous
,
get
medals
,
take
part
in
Olympiad
and
other
pretigious
competitions
.

The
amount
of
people
between
0
and
14
years
in
Yemen
in
2000
was
more
than
50
%
.

This
type
of
post
-
school
qualification
was
choosen
by
90
%
of
males
compared
to
10
%
of
females
.

On
the
other
hand
,
sport
is
a
way
to
express
your
feels
and
look
very
well
.

Looking
to
the
diagrams
,
which
connected
with
Italy
,
it
can
be
stressed
that
the
situation
is
almost
the
same
as
in
Yemen
.

People
who
choose
creative
professions
do
not
look
like
those
who
want
to
become
a
driver
or
a
banker
psycologically
.

As
a
whole
,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
solving
this
enviromenatal
problem
should
be
priority
now
,
specially
when
we
talk
about
air
pollution
.

In
2050
the
statistics
shows
us
a
change
in
the
demographic
numbers
.

The
last
reason
to
say
is
that
no
one
today
speaks
on
the
topics
about
politness
and
intelligence
which
are
very
important
.

In
my
opinion
,
sport
is
a
good
method
to
improve
our
health
,
so
the
increase
in
number
of
sports
facilities
will
give
our
population
a
strong
health
.

To
sum
up
,
it
can
be
clearly
seen
that
big
amount
of
sport
facilities
creates
biggest
interest
to
sport
and
to
active
style
of
life
.

To
sum
up
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
the
number
of
students
that
are
interested
in
career
depends
drops
with
the
grouth
age
.

The
\"
gap
year
\"
allows
students
to
take
a
necessary
break
and
get
prepared
both
mentally
and
in
terms
of
study
organization
.

As
for
old
people
,
who
are
more
than
60
years
old
,
their
number
will
increase
.

I
should
begin
with
the
oldest
one
.

The
bar
chart
provides
information
about
the
percentage
use
of
Facebook
,
Instagram
and
LinkedIn
among
Americans
by
age
group
.

And
finally
,
authorities
must
decrease
the
payed
for
the
CDs
,
DVDs
and
so
on
.

In
no
way
can
people
forget
about
themselves
and
be
fully
focused
on
their
job
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
that
China
had
reached
its
maximum
of
almost
90
%
by
the
end
of
the
period
,
showing
the
70
%
dissimilarity
with
Sweden
.

Therefore
,
children
are
more
influenced
by
these
changes
,
for
instance
,
in
education
.

Scientists
and
politicians
have
quarelled
about
the
best
way
to
improve
public
health
.

Beautiful
and
extraordinary
constructions
make
a
good
impression
on
us
,
so
we
should
encourage
architects
to
construct
buildings
which
will
look
beautiful
and
will
make
our
city
nice
.

There
is
different
situation
in
Europe
it
went
up
in
2015
but
the
gap
is
not
big
just
0,4
%
.

They
include
the
imformation
about
situation
in
2000
and
projections
for
2050
.

Thoughts
of
creative
people
may
change
the
world
and
make
it
a
better
place
to
live
in
.

The
last
but
not
the
least
,
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
a
young
person
to
find
a
job
in
modern
society
because
of
lack
of
working
experience
.

In
the
comparison
,
15
-
59
year
old
population
in
Italy
significantly
decrease
by
14,4
%
from
2000
to
2050
.

It
is
clear
that
rails
and
roads
were
used
differently
.

On
the
one
hand
,
the
ban
for
a
limited
period
gives
a
chance
for
an
athlete
to
continue
his
career
.

Our
body
wants
to
reflect
not
organic
parts
and
keeps
fighting
.

The
level
of
unemployment
in
Middle
East
decreased
significantly
,
it
was
11
%
in
2014
comparing
9,6
%
in
2015
.

Especially
,
that
pattern
was
very
widely
spread
in
the
last
periods
,
before
post
industrial
stage
of
development
.

One
more
fact
that
can
proove
my
position
is
that
it
was
scientifically
discovered
that
our
experiences
that
we
get
from
our
social
environment
can
radically
change
our
characters
,
views
and
opinions
.

The
chart
demonstrates
changes
accordingly
to
the
unemployment
rate
in
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

I
strongly
believe
that
everyone
can
make
a
mistake
,
so
the
athletes
who
use
illegal
drugs
should
be
panished
for
a
limited
period
.

To
conclude
my
essay
I
'd
like
to
say
that
I
disagree
with
the
universities
and
I
hope
that
they
understand
that
is
the
mistake
for
them
.

Generally
,
the
highest
rate
of
unemployment
relates
to
North
Africa
.

According
to
the
bar
graph
,
the
percentage
of
overweight
children
has
increased
during
20
years
from
11
to
25
percent
.

But
some
people
tthink
that
this
idea
is
wrong
and
dangerous
for
the
society
.

Person
,
who
is
involved
in
this
sphere
,
should
have
some
restricts
as
attitude
for
himself
using
anything
drugs
for
increase
a
power
level
is
the
thaboo
.

We
mad
about
internet
,
people
become
talking
to
each
other
in
face
-
to
-
face
method
rearely
.

To
begin
with
,
musicians
and
producers
lose
money
they
deserved
and
it
leads
to
lack
of
motivation
to
create
new
films
and
music
tracks
.

It
is
also
popular
for
young
adults
(
22
percent
)
and
for
old
people
(
22
percent
)
To
sum
up
,
it
can
be
seen
that
while
the
users
of
LinkedIn
are
of
all
ages
and
Facebook
is
also
popular
for
all
age
groups
,
instagram
mostly
attracts
young
adults
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
unemployment
rates
in
six
regions
of
the
world
,
both
in
2014
and
2015
.

Secondly
,
children
at
primary
school
have
less
problems
than
people
in
secondary
school
.

The
worldwide
has
the
same
sitiation
,
bar
remains
steady
from
2014
to
2015
and
percent
is
similary
5,9
%
.

The
same
change
for
Italy
is
from
14,3
%
in
2000
to
11,5
%
in
the
future
.

At
the
first
glance
,
we
can
clearly
see
that
the
percentage
of
transporting
different
manufactured
goods
was
the
highest
for
the
both
transportation
ways
-
by
rail
and
by
road
.

We
adapt
to
surrouding
world
and
circumstances
influence
on
our
personality
and
future
behavior
and
decisions
.

The
second
graph
shows
that
UK
residents
prefered
visiting
France
,
about
12
millions
of
them
,
in
1999
,
what
is
more
,
UK
residents
rarely
visited
Turkey
,
about
3
millions
of
them
in
1999
.

If
every
citizen
will
think
about
illegal
sharing
as
a
crime
,
the
copying
and
pirating
will
be
a
big
shame
and
no
one
will
do
this
.

It
illustrates
changings
in
2014
and
2015
.

People
from
ancient
times
show
their
ideas
and
thoughts
by
paintings
and
music
.

To
sum
up
,
Italy
and
Yemen
has
common
trend
for
2
groups
and
controry
for
3d
group
.

Moreover
,
we
can
see
how
many
people
visit
to
the
UK
.

I
'm
sure
that
only
people
who
spend
their
time
to
sport
activities
can
be
health
persons
in
our
modern
,
indastry
world
.

It
used
to
say
that
there
is
no
need
to
divide
the
main
cause
why
do
people
need
a
new
construction
and
why
do
n't
proffesionals
make
it
as
a
work
of
art
.

Some
people
believe
that
it
is
good
idea
,
however
,
others
disagree
with
that
statement
.

We
can
see
that
the
percentage
of
transporting
manufactured
goods
are
mostly
similar
.

Moreover
Moreover
,
,
as
as
it
it
was

said

Private
companies
will
help
these
small
towns
to
develope
their
working
conditions
and
as
a
result
they
gain
their
scientific
goals
.

Personally
I
can
partly
agree
with
the
first
point
of
view
,
as
sport
usually
has
a
good
impact
on
our
health
.

Some
people
declair
that
it
's
effective
to
provide
different
kinds
of
sport
activities
,
but
others
do
n't
take
this
fact
it
into
consideration
and
suggest
other
methods
.

By
contrast
only
10
%
of
woman
choosen
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

Firstly
,
as
consumption
has
a
prestigious
role
in
modern
society
,
many
teenagers
,
especially
ones
from
poor
and
working
class
families
,
realize
that
their
parents
are
not
available
to
buy
them
expensive
gifts
,
and
choose
breaking
the
law
as
means
of
getting
money
they
need
to
buy
expensive
and
cutting
-
edge
gadgets
and
technical
devices
as
well
as
fashionable
clothes
.

The
same
about
eBooks
in
these
two
countries
.

To
sum
up
,
the
ratio
of
people
using
Facebook
app
almost
doubled
in
the
period
from
2012
to
2013
.

On
the
other
hand
,
choosing
time
over
money
can
help
build
stronger
personal
relationships
and
avoid
health
problems
linked
to
stress
.

The
middle
-
aged
group
will
exceed
the
initial
number
by
11
percent
.

In
projection
for
2050
,
for
both
countries
amount
of
people
60
+
will
increase
considerably
.

The
highest
temperature
was
registered
at
the
point
of
25
°
C
above
zero
.

But
,
males
occupied
the
first
positio
in
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

Furthemore
,
it
is
clearly
seen
from
the
chart
that
the
average
unemployment
rate
for
all
the
regions
stood
steady
at
5,9
%
.

According
to
the
graphs
,
another
differences
that
in
the
first
graph
temperature
from
January
rise
until
July
and
deeply
falls
down
,
which
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
(
Brazil
)
temperature
slightly
falls
from
January
to
July
.

It
is
clear
that
we
should
try
to
prevent
or
solve
these
problems
together
.

It
also
take
money
from
budget
.

The
problem
of
producing
the
food
for
own
population
,
but
without
import
-
one
of
the
most
important
now
.

The
most
popular
sector
in
Australia
and
Indonesia
is
Services
.

This
is
the
only
way
we
can
fill
the
blanks
in
the
youngs
'
understanding
the
fact
that
violence
and
crime
are
strongly
unacceptable
.

For
example
,
it
is
a
common
knowledge
that
such
profession
as
a
driver
has
always
been
connected
with
man
because
it
requires
high
physical
and
mental
abilities
.

Speaking
about
changes
,
it
is
possible
to
admit
that
in
the
Middle
East
and
in
the
Latin
America
the
level
of
unemployment
is
higher
in
2014
that
in
2015
(
11
per
cent
vs
9,6
per
cent
in
the
Middle
East
and
6,8
per
cent
vs
5,8
per
cent
in
the
Latin
America
)
.

Power
afraid
of
this
trend
,
because
modern
art
can
influence
the
society
more
then
government
.

Apart
from
this
two
regions
the
unemployment
rate
stays
stable
.

However
,
in
reality
the
company
just
gave
too
low
a
dose
to
the
patiens
and
withheld
negative
trials
from
authority
.

73
percent
of
adults
are
eager
to
use
Facebook
as
the
main
social
website
.

Also
,
many
artists
and
other
creative
people
sometimes
criticize
things
,
which
happen
around
them
,
political
regime
for
example
.

Unsurprisingly
,
they
would
prefer
more
prestigious
and
well
-
paid
subject
,
even
if
they
are
not
interested
in
it
.

Last
but
not
least
,
importing
food
leads
to
a
wide
range
of
choise
so
natives
can
buy
whatever
they
want
.

Users
who
are
over
50
visit
such
websites
less
frequently
.

Some
people
are
not
able
to
do
some
sports
because
there
are
just
a
few
sport
centres
in
the
area
,
where
they
live
,
moreover
,
this
gyms
can
be
very
expensive
.

Nevertheless
,
patterns
stay
quite
similar
:
their
peaks
are
at
21:30
and
their
falls
are
between
6
and
9
o'clock
in
the
morning
.

Therefore
,
any
means
that
help
to
avoid
respecting
the
creator
's
right
must
be
limited
.

As
for
Yemen
,
it
is
clearly
noticed
that
half
of
all
population
is
children
from
0
to
14
years
old
in
2000
.

And
because
of
the
information
we
hot
we
can
say
that
both
sphere
of
transportation
are
importantin
out
lives
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
space
exploration
is
one
of
the
most
significant
parts
of
the
country
's
position
in
the
world
.

Second
,
there
is
a
possible
health
problem
in
the
using
social
networks
by
young
people
.

Not
with
standing
this
fact
,
many
people
believe
,
that
such
programmes
are
not
closely
connected
with
citizens
'
welfare
.

It
is
obviously
nowadays
that
the
issue
of
public
health
has
significant
influence
on
modern
life
.

Secondly
,
it
could
be
made
a
group
from
Paris
,
Tokyo
's
and
Washington
's
D.C
.
undergrounds
which
all
was
opened
in
twentieth
century
and
have
length
of
railways
more
then
100
kilometers
.

These
changes
have
passed
from
2000
to
2050
.

The
part
of
young
people
will
change
differently
.

I
claim
that
restrictions
on
teenager
's
access
to
the
Internet
will
help
a
lot
.

In
the
same
time
,
China
and
India
started
to
produce
more
energy
by
fossil
fuels
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
number
of
people
of
different
ages
using
various
social
network
in
America
.

The
presented
two
lines
graphs
illustrate
information
about
temperatures
in
two
cities
:
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Jeneiro
,
Brazil
during
a
year
.

When
the
government
supports
different
hobbies
connected
with
the
sport
,
people
start
to
do
it
from
the
childhood
.

So
,
in
2025
the
population
of
65
year
and
more
old
people
will
rise
to
about
25
percents
.

Through
the
years
Germany
and
New
Zealand
had
the
lowest
income
difference
on
average
,
including
the
lowest
difference
in
the
whole
chart
from
Germany
that
happened
to
be
only
ten
percent
.

There
are
some
individuals
,
for
example
,
who
go
to
work
earlier
instead
of
morning
run
or
fitness
.

It
is
obvious
that
our
world
develops
very
fast
today
providing
higher
life
quality
to
the
Earth
population
.

To
summarize
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
physical
differences
will
play
their
role
forever
.

In
conclusion
,
I
believe
that
we
should
struggle
with
discrimination
.

More
artists
and
writers
have
to
deal
with
censorship
daily
.

This
view
has
its
reasons
too
:
in
fear
of
the
permanent
ban
from
sports
,
athlets
are
less
likely
to
use
drugs
.

Every
parent
at
the
current
moment
has
realizing
that
the
competition
for
a
future
job
is
increasing
significantly
,
this
reason
brings
the
parent
to
think
as
best
as
possible
to
prepare
their
children
with
the
best
skill
to
compete
in
future
for
successful
job
.

This
essay
will
be
about
a
negative
influence
of
modern
technology
on
human
health
.

Taking
everithing
into
consideration
,
I
strongly
believe
that
united
attempts
can
shift
our
world
in
better
conditions
because
blossoming
countries
could
easily
help
ones
that
are
in
crisis
and
,
additionally
,
the
international
community
has
achieved
great
results
in
solving
global
problems
such
as
terrorism
.

There
are
lots
of
people
that
claims
that
utilization
of
the
outfashioned
technologies
will
help
to
people
fight
against
technological
pressure
and
decrease
the
lever
of
micro
and
radio
waves
.

It
's
good
or
not
?

It
is
significant
that
males
had
more
than
90
%
of
post
-
school
qualifications
,
meanwhile
female
had
only
more
than
10
%
.

Government
should
always
remember
of
the
freedom
of
art
and
artists
should
not
forget
about
the
law
.

Now
it
has
become
nearly
72
per
cent
.

The
second
highest
unemployment
is
in
Middle
East
and
it
reached
11
%
in
2014
and
dropped
to
9,6
%
in
2015
.

Besides
,
parents
and
school
teachers
should
pay
attention
to
adolescents
'
aspirations
and
help
them
to
choose
an
suitable
career
,
explaining
them
that
the
only
way
of
achieving
financial
stablility
and
prosperity
is
getting
education
and
hard
work
during
all
the
life
.

The
highest
temperatures
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
were
in
Janyary
,
whereas
in
contrast
Janyary
was
the
coldest
month
in
Yakutsk
.

Of
course
,
all
people
belive
that
their
journey
is
important
,
but
can
not
they
take
it
going
by
bus
or
by
train
?

However
,
she
does
not
pay
any
attention
on
her
health
condition
and
her
own
desires
.

We
become
older
and
more
wise
,
we
teach
on
our
faults
and
equire
knowledge
of
something
new
.

At
first
blush
,
a
great
disrepancy
can
be
noticed
between
winter
periods
in
the
cities
.

When
people
congratulate
someone
,
it
is
quite
common
to
wish
happiness
.

Moving
to
the
least
popular
area
of
employment
in
this
country
,
agricultural
sector
's
data
shows
approximately
5
%
of
workers
among
both
men
and
women
being
occupied
while
Australian
people
do
choose
to
provide
audience
with
services
as
almost
three
quaters
of
male
population
and
about
90
%
of
female
one
are
occupied
in
this
sphere
.

In
conclusion
,
two
countries
is
developing
differently
and
their
population
structures
is
expected
to
be
unsimilar
.

What
is
more
,
in
the
end
when
you
retire
you
will
not
be
able
to
enjoy
your
last
days
.

By
the
way
,
some
people
are
sure
that
faculties
should
accept
equal
members
of
women
and
men
.

But
,
at
the
same
time
,
on
the
diagramm
,
illustrated
goods
transported
by
road
,
metals
is
only
11
%
.

All
in
all
,
we
can
say
that
all
five
countries
show
us
the
tendency
to
lower
of
percentage
difference
in
earnings
between
men
and
women
,
even
though
it
was
fluctuating
a
little
bit
.

Children
have
many
responsibilities
,
that
is
why
they
often
forget
about
such
things
as
the
rest
in
some
parks
,
near
different
lakes
or
rivers
.

The
ate
6
cities
shown
in
the
table
.

Some
people
think
that
those
one
who
download
these
copies
,
should
be
punished
,
because
it
's
a
theft
.

If
we
want
to
live
in
a
respectful
society
,
but
sometimes
,
I
think
we
should
also
ask
ourselves
what
we
are
paying
for
.

Furthermore
,
if
language
has
been
learned
before
12
years
old
,
the
man
can
become
bilingual
person
.

Though
other
people
consider
freedom
of
self
-
expression
the
inalienable
quality
of
any
art
.

Nevertheless
,
making
the
house
as
fancy
as
one
can
is
an
purpos
which
worth
to
aim
because
it
is
always
better
to
admire
the
view
of
the
urban
jungles
.

Furthermore
,
technologies
provide
people
with
sport
equipment
which
can
make
exercise
more
effective
.

It
means
that
all
we
have
done
is
for
achieving
the
happiness
.

Unemployment
increased
only
in
region
EU
,
while
it
decreased
in
Latin
America
and
Middle
East
.

This
is
only
12
perscent
of
machinery
and
11
percents
of
chemicals
for
rail
transportation
.

Some
people
argue
that
the
improvement
of
sports
facilities
will
have
a
great
positive
effect
on
public
health
.

They
spend
money
for
creating
films
and
music
and
they
want
to
earn
more
.

Firstly
,
a
lot
of
states
have
no
ability
to
produce
all
essential
food
and
as
a
result
trying
to
avoid
import
can
lead
to
a
serious
health
problems
among
population
.

There
are
much
more
males
then
females
.

In
industry
the
percent
of
female
workers
is
dysmal
-
8
percent
.

Nevertheless
,
these
cases
are
rare
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
using
of
illegal
drugs
is
offense
,
but
every
case
is
particular
.

However
,
many
people
are
convinced
that
there
should
be
alternative
ways
to
make
the
level
of
crime
drop
down
.

Firstly
,
training
,
education
and
social
interactions
mostly
take
place
outside
of
the
family
.

Undoubtedly
,
almost
all
the
children
in
the
world
start
their
life
in
their
families
and
then
spend
it
with
the
great
influence
of
their
parents
and
relatives
,
making
also
new
acquaintances
at
school
and
then
at
work
,
who
affect
their
lives
as
well
.

Similarly
,
while
in
1990
studying
as
a
purpose
accounted
for
one
tenth
of
the
overall
percentage
,
a
decade
later
it
dropped
dramatically
,
being
the
smallest
part
of
the
whole
chart
.

In
90th
a
lot
of
young
musicians
stopped
their
repetitions
and
concerts
because
of
terrible
lack
of
money
.

In
Brazil
we
can
see
the
same
highest
temperature
during
the
July
.

It
can
be
seen
that
metals
are
transported
most
of
all
by
this
type
of
transportation
(
35
%
)
.

In
my
essay
I
will
focus
on
main
causes
and
solutions
to
this
issue
.

Nowadays
the
leisure
time
is
extremely
essential
for
many
people
.

In
case
a
person
needs
to
pay
for
surgery
or
restore
their
residence
after
a
fire
,
it
is
not
free
time
that
matters
but
financial
security
.

And
I
diagre
with
that
.

What
is
more
,
the
popularity
of
fossil
fuels
in
India
was
increasing
faster
than
in
China
,
as
the
former
rose
more
to
35
percent
,
from
1971
with
35
percent
to
2015
with
just
over
70
percent
.

Speaking
about
university
,
it
can
be
said
that
the
situation
of
equal
numbers
of
boys
and
girls
may
also
lead
to
relations
between
them
,
which
may
disturb
the
process
of
studing
.

In
our
town
,
there
are
free
sport
facilities
on
streets
and
yards
.

Another
solution
is
to
communicate
with
friends
of
your
child
.

The
second
bar
chart
shows
that
people
under
26
get
a
lot
of
support
from
their
employers
where
as
people
at
the
age
of
30
-
39
get
just
a
half
support
in
contast
with
people
under
26
.

The
table
provides
information
about
quantity
of
people
of
various
ages
working
in
different
sectors
in
UK
in
1998
and
2006
.

For
example
,
nowadays
it
is
possible
to
get
from
America
to
Australia
in
about
15
hours
,
which
some
years
ago
seemed
absolutely
impossible
.

For
instance
,
it
happened
with
Maria
Sharapova
.

Huge
amounts
of
working
migrants
just
could
not
be
employed
.

Percentage
of
old
people
in
Japan
will
significantly
increase
from
2030
to
2040
and
will
have
the
highest
percentage
in
2040
among
three
countries
.

First
of
all
,
It
should
be
said
about
the
line
temperatures
in
Russia
jump
and
surge
and
reach
a
peak
at
25
°
and
reach
a
low
point
at
-
40
°
C
.

Since
millenium
the
Japan
's
old
people
's
proportion
extremely
increased
for
more
than
20
%
in
40
years
.

It
can
be
a
good
use
of
their
time
at
primary
school
.

The
represented
chart
illustrates
the
unemployment
rate
in
certain
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
years
.

Every
kid
or
teenager
one
day
will
have
to
leave
his
or
her
private
family
community
and
learn
to
listen
to
other
authorities
,
such
as
teachers
or
friends
.

On
the
directing
faculty
,
for
example
,
people
can
exchange
their
experience
and
see
some
situations
as
for
women
side
,
as
for
man
.

Moreover
,
almost
90
%
of
people
between
18
and
29
use
Facebook
,
which
is
the
biggest
amount
of
people
involved
among
all
of
three
networks
.

Popularity
of
ebooks
will
grow
in
2018
in
all
four
countries
.

Anyway
,
I
truly
believe
that
if
you
are
hardworking
than
nothing
is
impossible
,
whatever
other
people
think
.

The
proportion
of
adults
from
different
age
groups
using
LinkedIn
was
generally
lower
than
40
per
cent
.

The
rapid
growth
of
the
eBook
industry
is
predicted
in
the
U.
S.
by
2018
,
from
5.5
billions
to
8.5
precisely
,
while
in
other
countries
this
growth
is
not
so
noticeable
.

Secondly
,
there
is
an
another
tendency
-
most
of
women
prefered
to
take
the
undergraduate
diploma
or
the
bachelor
's
degree
:
70
percent
against
37
percent
approximately
and
53
percent
approximately
against
48
percents
approximately
.

The
aim
of
performers
is
to
attract
the
audience
attention
and
sometimes
they
break
all
rules
and
do
amoral
things
,
which
can
shock
other
people
.

Most
of
the
counrys
nowadays
trading
with
the
others
a
lot
,
but
is
this
the
right
thing
for
a
country
to
import
tons
of
food
rather
than
try
to
produce
it
itself
?

As
can
be
seen
from
the
graph
,
there
is
no
striking
difference
in
the
unemployment
rates
between
2014
and
2015
in
all
selected
regions
.

To
emphasize
once
again
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
many
people
suppose
that
such
crimes
with
illegal
downloading
products
are
not
so
significant
.

The
proportion
of
population
is
quite
stable
with
make
a
significient
increase
till
30
%
,
which
will
be
the
highest
percent
according
to
the
other
countries
.

Nevertheless
,
sometimes
copies
are
quite
useful
because
you
do
not
need
to
save
money
for
that
DVD
with
\"
The
beauty
and
the
beast
\"
.

First
of
all
,
we
should
understand
,
that
the
way
,
how
we
express
our
opinion
should
n't
hert
anybody
.

Different
trend
is
showing
by
Latin
America
region
.

This
reaction
may
be
dangerous
,
like
not
very
peacefall
demonstrations
against
this
punishment
.

In
2014
there
were
7,5
%
of
people
without
job
,
but
it
rised
in
2015
by
0,4
%
,
giving
7,9
%
of
unemployment
rate
in
EU
.

Can
we
make
a
world
where
art
is
a
value
more
money
-
dependent
by
charging
money
for
art
?

However
,
people
at
the
age
from
50
to
65
+
know
about
it
.

I
believe
,
that
a
country
should
try
to
help
other
nations
of
the
world
,
but
only
if
it
does
not
have
urgent
and
crucial
problems
of
its
own
.

Chemicals
placed
5th
in
transport
in
by
rail
and
3rd
in
goods
transported
by
road
.

Cities
like
Vienna
,
Rome
or
Paris
are
well
-
known
examples
that
represent
the
meaning
of
architecture
in
the
number
of
visitors
.

We
ca
n't
become
happy
without
any
people
nearby
under
no
circumstances
.

Nevertheless
,
how
can
we
become
stronger
and
reduse
bad
influence
of
computer
?

The
most
effective
way
is
to
organize
different
social
programmes
and
events
to
motivate
people
doing
sport
.

Lots
of
problems
can
be
solved
without
government
help
.

The
fact
is
,
two
points
of
view
on
this
situation
exists
some
people
believe
that
athletes
who
used
illegal
drugs
should
be
banned
from
profession
competitions
for
a
limited
period
(
i.e.
2
years
)
.

Among
middle
aged
people
(
30
-
49
years
)
it
is
used
by
73
%
and
by
63
%
and
56
%
among
those
who
are
between
50
and
64
and
those
who
are
older
than
65
respectively
.

Overall
,
it
is
important
to
mention
,
that
everything
depends
on
a
person
,
who
is
involved
in
using
technologies
.

There
are
different
points
of
view
on
this
subject
.

Actually
,
to
have
real
friends
is
much
more
plaesant
than
a
nice
house
on
the
coast
of
a
sea
.

All
in
all
,
it
is
clear
from
these
bar
charts
that
the
situation
with
general
population
is
the
same
in
both
countries
,
whereas
there
is
a
huge
difference
in
the
percentage
of
white
and
non
-
white
prison
poplulation
in
the
UK
and
the
USA
.

The
first
way
is
by
rail
,
second
way
is
by
road
.

As
a
result
,
these
people
do
not
have
enough
free
time
,
but
they
believe
that
it
is
a
good
investigetion
for
the
future
.

But
the
pirat
sites
gives
accesss
to
all
kind
of
content
even
you
are
too
young
.

The
axes
demonstrate
how
the
unemployment
rate
changes
in
world
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

What
is
more
,
not
everyone
knows
about
his
or
her
hidden
talents
and
so
can
not
develop
them
.

Elderly
people
do
not
like
to
use
Instagram
.

In
Russia
there
is
an
opinion
that
health
is
the
main
thing
in
the
life
and
all
other
points
will
be
achieved
if
you
are
healthy
.

There
is
far
lot
of
information
about
them
in
newspapers
and
in
the
internet
.

Secondly
,
the
size
of
countries
varies
.

These
groups
make
teenagers
agressive
and
children
think
that
it
is
normal
to
do
crime
for
money
or
for
your
own
reasons
.

Creating
the
additional
sport
centers
is
the
foremost
solution
to
this
problem
.

Making
such
decision
,
people
are
eager
to
use
the
possible
chance
in
their
life
to
earn
money
for
future
.

Another
significant
drawback
is
that
for
some
countries
exporting
food
is
the
only
way
to
boost
their
economy
effectively
,
and
aborting
it
may
cause
an
economical
disaster
.

Secondly
,
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
watch
films
and
listen
to
the
music
in
a
good
quality
.

The
features
fluctuated
from
18000
to
20000
units
during
the
day
.

There
are
different
views
about
problems
of
sport
and
health
.

Who
knows
,
maybe
in
the
future
we
will
thank
our
government
for
the
amount
of
money
they
spend
on
this
.

The
majority
of
population
consisted
of
people
from
15
to
69
years
.

Is
one
gender
more
succesfull
in
define
subject
or
not
and
should
universities
accept
the
same
quantity
of
man
and
woman
-
are
the
questions
that
provoke
concerns
.

To
begin
with
,
the
main
goal
of
every
government
is
to
provide
the
safety
and
comfort
for
its
population
.

Firstly
,
I
agree
that
this
is
a
big
problem
in
these
industries
.

The
chart
provides
the
information
about
the
rate
of
unemployment
in
5
world
regions
and
worldwide
in
whole
with
the
difference
of
one
year
-
from
2014
to
2015
.

In
the
modern
world
,
it
is
claimed
that
technologies
might
have
a
negative
impact
on
people
's
health
.

It
consists
of
five
positions
:
skilled
vocational
diploma
,
undergraduate
diploma
,
Bachelor
's
degree
,
postgraduate
diploma
and
Master
's
degree
.

The
line
graphs
describe
the
limits
of
average
temperatures
in
two
different
cities
:
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

But
speaking
about
passengers
it
is
in
the
middle
of
the
list
.

There
was
a
constant
growth
of
the
persentage
of
overwheigh
girls
,
as
the
figures
show
that
each
5
years
the
number
rised
on
approximately
3
%
.

So
medicaments
will
become
more
available
for
poor
ill
people
.

At
the
first
glance
,
it
is
clear
that
in
every
country
except
Yemen
in
2000
the
majority
of
population
consists
of
people
from
15
to
59
years
.

I
suppose
that
it
is
a
good
idea
.

These
life
shocks
include
death
of
a
relative
,
poverty
,
the
lose
of
a
house
or
bancropcy
of
a
parent
,
and
more
others
.

The
situation
was
alike
about
the
Master
's
degree
,
women
were
not
as
much
interested
in
becoming
a
Master
and
they
make
up
only
40
per
cent
of
those
who
got
this
degree
.

The
table
presents
data
on
differences
of
emploement
by
gender
in
2010
in
Indonesia
and
Australia
in
three
employment
sectors
which
were
agriculture
,
industry
and
sevices
.

Numbers
of
people
say
that
it
is
possible
to
improve
health
level
opening
new
sport
facilities
,
while
others
are
against
it
,
arguing
that
it
is
ineffecient
way
for
people
.

For
example
in
every
film
we
can
see
some
brend
of
clothes
,
marks
of
cars
,
or
food
like
Twix
,
Orep
e.t.c
.
If
we
will
think
on
that
side
,
then
somebody
still
and
share
the
film
on
the
internet
it
is
not
a
problem
,
because
all
people
can
see
and
the
creator
does
not
lose
lots
of
money
.

It
starts
in
5
percent
and
do
n't
have
a
higher
level
before
1983
.

Indeed
,
the
20th
century
totally
changes
the
lifestyle
of
people
,
because
there
have
been
invented
some
unbelievable
things
like
the
Internet
or
a
mobile
phone
.

All
in
all
,
Facebook
is
the
most
popular
network
among
all
the
adults
,
especially
in
the
group
of
those
who
are
between
18
and
29
years
old
because
about
90
%
of
them
use
it
.

First
of
all
,
people
are
not
born
criminals
-
they
become
gangsters
and
thieves
for
some
reason
.

It
is
possible
to
say
that
their
main
problem
is
education
.

Besides
,
there
is
a
tendency
that
women
prefer
to
work
in
service
fraction
(
88
%
)
,
while
for
Indonesia
this
indicator
consists
49
%
and
it
is
lower
than
for
men
around
7
points
.

So
,
what
should
parents
and
teachers
do
to
find
the
solution
of
this
problem
?

The
key
is
people
can
buy
happiness
with
the
help
of
money
.

We
lose
something
that
art
serves
to
.

Nowadays
it
is
possible
to
download
music
and
films
from
the
internet
without
any
payment
.

It
means
the
equal
rights
between
both
sexes
in
university
.

All
in
all
,
there
is
no
changes
in
worldwide
unemployment
rate
.

Is
it
reasonable
to
build
more
sport
facilities
?

First
of
all
,
it
is
obvious
that
millennials
at
their
current
age
have
more
opportunities
and
higher
living
standards
than
their
parents
or
grandparents
had
.

The
number
of
15
-
59
years
old
people
was
46,3
%
and
approximately
3,6
%
of
people
were
older
than
60
years
.

It
may
influence
even
food
habits
such
as
eating
healthy
or
unhealthy
food
.

It
will
rise
from
46,3
%
to
57,3
%
in
Yemen
,
but
in
Italy
it
will
fall
on
one
third
,
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

For
instance
,
when
you
come
to
any
touristic
place
in
Europe
and
come
to
a
local
shop
,
there
are
not
many
local
goods
or
symbols
of
the
country
you
have
come
-
there
are
just
post
cards
or
some
really
ordinary
clothes
,
hence
if
you
want
to
get
some
national
spirit
,
you
should
get
acquainted
with
the
locals
.

There
are
many
anvantages
and
disadvantages
from
the
both
points
of
view
.

As
the
bar
chart
reveals
,
the
USA
is
a
leader
in
a
book
consumption
.

The
number
of
elderly
men
and
women
who
lived
in
USA
increased
slightly
.

Definition
of
happiness
depends
on
many
different
things
.

In
order
to
prove
this
statistics
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
using
the
electricity
.

The
bar
chart
provides
information
about
the
most
popular
foreign
destinations
among
people
who
live
in
the
UK
.

That
's
why
I
support
the
idea
,
that
every
country
should
produce
as
much
as
possible
to
be
involved
into
international
market
and
get
many
monetary
advantages
from
it
.

The
universities
are
obliged
to
hold
different
entrance
lists
for
man
and
women
with
different
entrance
marks
.

For
example
,
it
is
possible
to
change
the
brightness
of
the
phone
,
so
eyes
will
not
get
hurt
.

Then
we
can
see
a
slight
decrease
in
their
number
from
1940
to
1960
.

The
Problem
of
need
in
foreign
food
supplies
and
lack
of
native
production
is
facing
among
vast
range
of
countries
nowadays
.

Nowadays
,
for
different
countries
It
is
a
big
sector
of
economy
to
transport
food
to
over
countries
and
sell
it
there
.

What
is
more
,
the
children
often
show
that
they
are
interested
in
some
spheres
in
a
very
early
age
.

First
-
I
have
been
known
a
lot
of
people
,
who
is
not
able
to
spend
money
for
this
.

In
particular
the
biggest
rate
of
unemployment
was
in
the
North
Africa
and
shown
the
result
of
12,5
percent
both
in
2014
and
2015
.

The
science
is
the
engine
that
makes
people
develop
and
this
engine
should
never
be
stopped
.

For
example
,
student
want
to
be
a
doctor
but
there
are
enough
male
that
's
why
he
goes
to
teacher
's
faculty
.

For
example
:
the
building
looks
great
,
it
is
fashianable
but
the
main
problem
is
that
there
are
no
facilities
there
for
people
,
for
officies
,
for
work
.

In
this
case
gender
does
not
matter
.

Other
qualifications
were
less
popular
among
men
,
but
significulty
more
widespread
among
women
.

Firstly
,
many
children
receive
poor
attention
from
their
parents
today
because
both
parents
usually
work
full
time
nowadays
.

People
can
create
everything
or
enjoy
art
,
that
created
by
other
people
.

In
conclusion
,
I
think
that
creative
artists
should
do
everything
if
they
do
not
break
the
government
's
restrictions
and
laws
.

Why
did
the
crime
rates
increase
so
sharply
and
who
is
responsidle
for
such
behavior
?

The
line
graph
illustrate
the
number
of
people
aged
65
and
over
in
some
countries
,
like
Japan
,
Sweden
and
USA
in
the
percontage
from
1940
to
2040
.

This
bar
chart
provides
us
information
about
unemployment
in
different
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

For
example
,
a
big
family
which
consists
of
5
members
:
mother
,
father
,
grandmother
and
two
brothers
.

In
my
opinion
,
whole
the
life
disqualification
should
exist
as
a
form
of
possible
punishment
,
as
a
note
for
all
the
athlets
to
be
honest
:
with
themselves
,
their
fans
and
other
competitors
,
however
prooves
have
to
be
strong
and
obvious
to
use
this
kind
of
banning
.

Although
author
rights
appreciation
should
become
common
,
I
could
not
agree
with
the
concept
of
olligatory
punishment
for
both
traders
and
users
.

So
we
may
see
that
sharp
line
which
\"
belongs
\"
to
USA
is
the
most
steady
.

To
sum
up
,
one
can
only
hope
that
one
day
we
will
understand
the
true
nature
of
development
and
we
will
use
it
taking
the
full
advantages
and
minimizing
the
danger
of
self
-
prediction
effect
.

Unfortunately
,
many
people
are
strongly
needed
to
buy
remedies
and
to
be
cared
,
but
the
greates
sums
of
the
country
's
budget
go
to
our
football
team
salary
.

In
all
another
reasons
there
are
more
women
than
men
.

Music
and
films
are
not
usually
associated
with
classic
private
goods
and
it
has
to
be
changed
.

All
these
social
illnesses
are
disgusting
,
and
all
governments
all
over
the
world
try
to
solve
such
problems
.

The
good
solution
for
this
problem
is
the
control
of
social
or
state
institutions
of
the
attitude
to
these
children
in
families
.

It
is
obvious
that
two
countries
have
different
tendencies
in
population
.

But
these
problem
is
very
difficult
and
needs
further
discussion
.

The
longest
metro
is
in
London
(
the
length
is
almost
400
kilometres
)
and
it
is
the
oldest
one
-
it
was
opened
in
1863
.

First
of
all
,
it
is
clear
from
the
graph
that
American
revenue
was
and
might
stay
the
highest
one
in
both
spheres
in
both
periods
.

First
of
all
,
it
helps
us
to
be
in
a
good
shape
and
reduce
extra
fat
in
our
organism
that
can
be
harmful
and
cause
some
desieses
.

From
the
graph
is
obvious
that
France
,
Sweden
and
America
have
aimed
to
introduce
more
alternative
energy
sources
,
while
other
countries
tend
to
have
difficulties
with
the
realization
of
it
.

I
believe
,
that
charity
activity
and
helping
and
teaching
to
youngers
can
teach
olders
what
it
feels
to
be
kind
for
others
,
can
show
us
what
we
can
better
than
we
already
are
,
and
also
what
we
can
make
our
world
better
and
much
more
beautifull
together
.

Personaly
I
can
not
agree
with
the
statement
.

Such
measures
will
not
only
benefit
in
the
public
health
,
but
also
in
ecologic
means
.

This
example
illistrates
that
increasing
the
number
of
sport
facilities
should
go
alongside
with
other
measures
.

In
addition
,
beautiful
houses
with
interesting
architecture
can
inspire
different
people
to
create
something
wonderful
.

Yemen
's
majority
in
both
charts
consist
of
people
younger
than
59
(
more
than
90
%
in
both
cases
)
,
and
Italy
's
majority
are
people
aver
15
years
old
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
authorities
should
spend
time
and
finances
to
develop
their
own
countries
.

In
conclusion
I
want
to
say
that
government
will
try
to
raise
up
the
percent
of
young
population
,
help
families
with
money
,
but
the
graph
(
population
)
will
increase
if
only
people
want
it
.

The
implementation
of
new
tools
will
not
change
their
preferences
and
they
will
continue
to
do
the
same
,
but
in
the
different
place
.

As
the
problem
of
using
drugs
is
spreading
,
people
believe
that
banning
sportsmen
for
the
rest
of
their
life
is
the
best
option
.

First
of
all
,
China
has
one
the
highest
statistic
of
energy
.

Personally
,
I
think
that
only
a
family
can
make
a
really
huge
contribution
to
improving
national
health
.

The
second
graph
depict
workers
employes
in
3
given
spheres
in
Australia
.

Secondly
,
it
is
necessary
to
invent
harmless
screens
that
would
not
destroy
our
eyes
.

Washington
DC
holds
the
middle
position
in
the
list
,
while
the
newest
railway
systems
that
are
located
in
Kyoto
and
Los
Angeles
are
the
least
developed
n
terms
of
kilometres
of
route
and
the
amount
of
people
served
.

To
conclude
,
we
can
give
an
opinion
that
the
projections
for
the
future
looks
rather
realistic
.
and
it
is
important
to
take
in
mind
all
this
data
information
.

Overall
,
the
highest
temperature
in
Yakutsk
is
about
25
°
degrees
compared
to
exactly
30
°
degrees
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
whereas
the
minimum
temperature
in
Yakutsk
is
around
-
40
°
C
degrees
while
the
same
thing
can
be
observed
at
the
temperature
of
about
18
°
C
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

So
they
would
invent
the
new
type
of
planes
which
would
be
\"
pollution
free
\"
and
its
using
would
not
cause
any
climat
problems
.

If
each
of
us
will
do
it
than
it
will
be
the
best
way
to
improve
public
health
.

An
example
to
this
statement
can
be
served
pupils
,
who
learn
English
since
first
class
,
have
more
opportunite
to
be
successful
in
language
than
children
who
do
n't
study
languages
.

Taking
all
the
mentioned
into
consideration
,
Americans
spend
the
most
amont
of
money
on
both
printed
editions
and
Ebooks
,
though
the
distribution
between
will
be
different
in
4
years
,
while
in
the
UK
these
numbers
will
be
quite
steady
.

The
first
graph
shows
that
summer
is
period
pf
stablish
.

It
is
no
secret
to
anyone
that
creativity
plays
a
dominant
role
in
almost
every
sector
of
artist
's
life
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
some
differences
between
these
graphs
.

I
completely
agree
with
this
statement
and
I
would
like
to
express
my
opinion
on
this
situation
.

So
the
maximum
of
minimum
of
temperature
in
Yakutsk
is
around
10
°
C
.

If
someone
wants
to
improve
the
eqiciency
of
any
group
to
be
equalling
the
number
of
men
and
women
he
runs
a
risk
of
having
a
lack
of
smart
or
creative
people
.

It
may
be
interesting
,
therefore
there
are
a
different
opportuinities
for
competition
.

First
of
all
,
the
USA
benefit
from
print
books
in
2014
consisted
10,5
billion
of
US
dollars
,
while
nearly
the
half
of
this
amount
of
money
was
received
from
eBook
trade
(
5,5
billion
)
.

If
this
thinks
county
will
buy
,
not
produce
,
it
's
be
more
expensive
,
than
producing
in
own
country
.

Let
us
speculate
on
this
controversial
issue
.

All
things
considered
,
it
is
hard
to
say
wheter
scientific
researches
provided
by
private
companies
will
succeed
.

It
can
leed
to
drug
and
alcohol
addictions
.

The
amount
of
online
users
of
old
people
the
same
like
young
people
.

Nowadays
,
we
are
leaving
in
modern
democratic
society
,
which
means
freedom
for
art
expressions
,
too
.

Others
argue
that
any
work
of
architecture
should
also
be
attractive
.

Differences
in
December
and
in
July
are
more
different
than
in
Brazil
.

Massage
services
have
a
good
influence
on
people
,
who
have
problems
with
parts
of
their
body
.

And
the
government
must
n't
punish
them
because
of
the
fact
that
,
they
do
n't
buy
original
discs
.

All
of
this
factors
change
the
child
,
make
him
to
grow
up
.

The
biggest
and
the
longest
URS
is
in
London
with
394
kilometres
of
route
.

It
is
impossible
to
give
a
definition
for
it
.

Also
decrease
in
2050
people
who
0
-
14
years
age
.

The
bar
chart
depicts
the
process
and
predictions
about
recent
and
future
development
of
the
book
market
in
the
US
,
Germany
,
China
and
the
United
Kingdom
.

Looking
at
information
in
more
detail
,
there
were
no
fluctiations
in
unemployment
rates
in
North
Africa
and
South
Asia
at
levels
12,5
%
and
3,9
%
respectively
during
two
-
year
period
.

The
other
want
a
good
health
.

In
Yemen
there
will
be
substantial
decrease
in
children
population
.

Many
people
say
that
it
is
too
difficult
to
begin
to
study
foreign
language
when
you
do
n't
even
know
how
to
use
properly
your
mother
tongue
.

Therefore
,
I
agree
that
people
who
download
music
and
films
break
the
law
and
should
be
punished
.

In
conclusion
I
would
like
to
say
that
in
21st
century
art
become
more
aviable
for
artists
as
well
as
for
everyone
else
,
who
would
enjoy
arts
.

In
addition
,
the
example
of
manufactures
is
suitable
.

To
conclude
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
we
should
obey
the
law
of
intellectual
property
.

People
are
very
different
,
every
person
has
his
own
favourite
activities
and
everyone
should
choose
the
way
,
depending
on
his
lifestyle
,
interests
,
facilities
.

However
,
Worldwide
rate
does
n't
change
in
these
years
and
still
5,9
percent
.

Recent
data
reveals
that
more
and
more
adolescents
get
involved
in
crimes
,
therefore
the
problem
requires
quick
and
efficient
solution
.

Everyone
place
has
own
purpose
that
is
why
location
must
connecting
with
it
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
rates
of
urban
/
suburban
and
rural
households
which
had
Internet
in
some
European
country
in
the
period
199
-
2004
.

By
comparison
the
development
of
print
books
In
Germany
will
equal
with
in
2014
.

Nowadays
,
some
people
think
that
athletes
caught
using
illegal
drugs
should
be
banned
from
competing
professionally
for
a
limited
period
of
time
.

And
print
books
market
in
going
to
decrease
slighty
in
all
countries
,
exept
Germany
.

In
my
opinion
,
it
is
right
position
.

On
the
contrary
,
boys
were
obviously
more
overweight
than
girls
after
1995
(
21
-
25
%
vs
20
-
22
%
respectively
)
.

In
addition
,
the
main
difference
of
temperature
averages
in
these
cities
is
that
in
Yakutsk
is
hot
summer
in
compared
with
frost
winter
whereas
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
the
temperature
is
usually
the
same
in
each
months
.

Thirdly
,
looking
at
the
monitor
for
many
hours
can
really
damage
our
eyes
.

Secondly
,
they
say
that
it
's
a
exome
,
because
there
is
a
law
about
protection
of
author
's
rights
in
the
big
range
of
countries
.

Almost
in
all
given
regions
the
rate
stays
:
unchanged
during
the
presented
period
of
time
and
anly
few
shifts
are
shown
The
level
decreased
in
Latin
America
for
just
1
percent
and
a
dramatic
drop
in
Middle
East
from
11
percent
to
9,6
percent
.

The
question
is
:
should
our
government
spend
more
money
trying
to
change
this
situation
or
is
it
better
to
leave
it
alone
?

Illegal
drugs
alter
the
condition
of
competition
to
the
point
where
your
spirit
and
passion
do
not
matter
.

And
there
is
no
scientific
proof
that
sport
helps
to
prevent
regular
diseases
.

Moreover
,
speaking
from
the
prospectives
of
employees
working
in
such
corporations
,
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
conditions
do
not
correspond
to
standarts
.

By
the
way
,
we
may
achieve
public
health
in
alternative
ways
.

Master
's
degree
was
more
widespread
among
men
,
about
60
%
got
it
.

It
is
extremely
important
to
get
ready
for
university
studies
in
a
unwind
atmosphere
.

The
noticeable
fact
is
that
more
than
a
half
males
and
females
got
post
-
school
qualifications
in
Australia
in
1999
,
but
they
chose
different
stages
of
this
education
.

Moreover
,
the
overall
number
of
people
working
in
agriculture
in
Australia
accounts
for
4
%
,
and
the
number
of
those
in
Indonesia
is
72
%
,
what
is
around
18
times
more
.

In
Sweden
there
was
also
slight
drop
from
1980
but
only
to
1990
and
then
rise
to
20
%
of
people
ages
65
and
over
until
2010
.

Some
people
believe
that
there
must
be
as
much
female
students
as
male
students
in
every
subject
.

But
there
are
people
,
who
're
against
the
\"
rest
year
\"
.

The
first
bar
graph
illustrate
that
users
more
often
enter
into
Facebook
by
the
mobaile
phone
,
but
not
by
the
desktop
.

Firstly
,
hi
-
tech
helps
people
and
they
become
more
passive
in
movement
,
and
that
causing
heart
attacks
.

On
the
one
hand
,
the
level
of
American
and
British
films
is
rather
high
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
do
something
better
or
at
least
the
same
.

Firstly
,
the
number
of
male
and
female
students
does
not
matter
for
studing
process
.

I
think
art
do
n't
need
the
control
because
artists
are
creative
people
and
they
must
not
do
what
people
want
.

This
problem
is
worth
discussing
.

The
common
situation
is
illustrated
in
the
bar
chart
for
the
world
.

For
North
Africa
and
South
Asia
this
rate
is
12,5
%
and
3,9
%
respectively
.

The
youngest
one
is
LA
underground
which
started
only
in
year
2001
.

Modern
countries
produce
a
lot
of
food
for
their
citizens
or
for
export
and
it
is
no
the
news
.

It
is
clear
for
me
that
people
who
think
that
athlets
should
not
be
banned
forever
can
not
be
absolutely
right
because
sport
means
honesty
and
true
spirit
of
competition
.

It
is
clear
to
see
that
the
highest
proportion
of
males
was
in
skilled
vocational
diplomas
,
about
90
%
,
ninetimes
more
than
that
of
females
.

The
graph
presents
the
data
about
the
proportion
of
the
population
aged
65
and
over
between
1940
and
2040
in
the
different
countries
.

Also
,
children
do
not
have
enough
time
to
play
after
school
and
homework
because
it
is
too
late
to
play
at
the
street
.

Underground
was
open
in
2001
,
have
only
twenty
eight
kilometres
and
using
only
by
50
milions
people
per
year
,
but
,
for
example
Kyoto
have
only
11
killometres
and
using
by
45
milions
passengers
,
however
the
system
in
Kyoto
was
start
in
1981
.

Nevertheless
,
to
get
money
you
have
to
work
,
that
is
why
some
people
prefer
to
earn
more
money
sacrifizing
their
free
time
,
while
for
others
their
free
time
is
more
important
than
getting
much
money
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
clear
that
in
Italy
the
number
of
old
people
is
increasing
while
in
Yemen
it
is
predicted
that
there
will
be
more
people
of
working
age
in
2050
in
comparison
with
2000
.

However
,
there
is
one
region
that
do
not
math
with
main
trend
.

This
causes
lack
of
time
,
which
parents
should
give
to
their
childrens
.

All
in
all
,
we
can
see
a
large
discrapancy
in
numbers
,
comparing
different
world
regions
.

Regarding
the
highest
level
of
tempereture
,
we
can
see
that
the
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
reaches
its
peak
of
30
degrees
above
zero
in
January
.

It
is
very
diffucult
question
,
that
takes
big
number
of
hard
discussions
.

It
is
obviously
that
people
at
the
age
from
18
to
29
are
greater
interedted
in
such
progams
than
the
old
people
.

Nowadays
many
schools
face
a
problem
which
is
connected
with
their
students
behaviour
.

To
my
mind
,
taking
a
gap
year
can
be
very
beneficial
for
a
future
student
.

It
can
be
noticed
that
all
countries
have
an
increasing
number
of
people
aged
65
and
over
in
the
period
from
2020
till
2040
-
it
has
above
20
%
and
above
25
%
in
Japan
.

According
to
EU
,
the
unemployment
rate
had
upward
trend
.

So
,
the
only
way
to
stop
the
crimes
with
author
's
rights
is
to
create
a
better
system
to
regulate
producing
pirate
copies
.

However
,
the
sums
of
dollars
spent
on
paper
books
produced
all
over
the
world
is
gradually
declining
,
as
it
is
more
convenient
to
develop
electronic
books
.

My
best
friend
watches
that
tournaments
and
he
always
speaks
about
the
sports
,
so
all
people
of
our
group
and
parents
also
interested
in
that
.

The
successful
example
of
avoiding
the
problems
of
sleeping
is
using
phones
,
laptops
or
computers
the
last
time
before
going
to
bed
in
two
hours
at
least
.

The
temperature
levels
fall
in
summer
to
the
lowest
point
of
25
°
C
maximum
in
June
in
about
18
°
C
minimum
in
July
.

It
is
also
connected
with
globalization
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
not
only
responsibility
of
families
and
schools
but
also
the
whole
society
to
solve
behavioral
problems
.

While
in
United
States
,
nearly
100
percent
of
this
kind
of
energy
was
involved
.

AS
IT
MAY
BE
SEEN
FROM
THE
BAR
CHART
,
87
%
OF
THE
YOUNG
UNDER
29
USES
IT
.

It
is
also
interesting
that
Sweden
and
USA
demonstrated
the
fluctuating
growth
bet
Japan
's
'
elder
generation
's
number
'
stagnated
during
60
years
and
only
in
2030
it
is
suggested
to
expand
quickly
.

Others
want
such
athletes
to
be
banned
permanently
.

At
the
same
time
,
28
percents
of
road
traffic
is
taken
for
the
same
manufactured
goods
.

It
can
help
to
have
a
perfect
fisical
forms
and
shapes
,
but
does
it
really
works
?

Secondly
,
with
the
children
being
more
preoccupied
with
extracarricular
activities
there
would
be
less
time
for
them
to
break
the
law
.

Everyone
knows
that
there
is
a
division
of
subjects
on
tunkal
,
social
,
economic
and
so
on
.

To
the
end
,
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
best
idea
of
stopping
crime
is
trying
to
give
a
comprehensive
deveplopment
of
personality
frome
childhood
.

The
biggest
dinamic
of
rate
of
people
,
who
can
not
find
a
job
happened
in
Middle
East
and
the
difference
between
2014
and
2015
year
was
1,4
%
.

One
people
think
,
that
creative
people
should
not
have
any
restrictions
.

The
first
subway
was
opened
in
London
in
1863
,
were
394
kilometres
in
route
and
was
I
pushed
by
775
millions
of
people
per
year
.

What
is
more
,
the
higher
percent
of
emloyer
support
and
the
age
of
studying
for
career
is
considered
to
bein
the
under
26
age
group
.

Moreover
,
professional
sport
competing
is
an
extremely
moral
area
whith
a
high
standarts
of
honesty
and
strick
approach
to
punishment
.

Moreover
,
it
is
praised
in
many
religions
and
philosophical
schools
.

Because
it
is
constructed
rather
recently
,
it
has
a
small
distance
in
kilometers
,
only
28
.

Modern
society
is
divided
about
the
ways
of
spending
children
's
time
,
because
everything
in
the
world
has
its
pros
and
cons
,
and
children
's
life
is
not
an
exception
.

In
contrast
,
machinery
has
six
time
many
n
percentage
for
railway
transportation
.

The
unemployment
rate
of
Middle
East
has
decreased
from
11
%
to
9,6
%
respectively
.

Moreover
,
there
are
some
health
problems
and
solutions
for
decreasing
the
number
of
such
a
deseases
.

The
graph
shows
that
the
biggest
difference
of
income
between
men
and
women
was
in
Japan
:
over
40
%
respectively
in
1985
.

The
number
of
people
studying
in
such
places
had
also
decreased
dramatically
(
10
%
in
1990
and
2
%
in
2000
)
.

Due
to
the
Internet
acces
,
films
adn
music
can
be
easily
downloaded
and
shared
without
any
payment
.

The
demonstrated
charts
indicate
the
changes
in
the
age
groups
'
percentage
of
Yemen
and
Italy
in
the
period
from
2000
till
the
present
day
,
moreover
including
predictions
for
the
nearest
future
.

For
example
,
few
boys
feel
uncomfortable
among
many
girls
.

First
of
all
,
the
bigger
number
of
the
sport
facilities
can
solve
the
situation
with
the
health
,
because
it
's
a
good
way
of
giving
people
different
opportunities
.

But
I
do
not
know
people
who
really
wanted
something
and
did
not
get
it
.

Community
excercises
,
such
as
flexes
,
bendings
and
aerobics
can
both
improve
the
overall
worker
's
performance
and
the
emotional
unity
of
the
crew
.

But
ow
everybody
uses
phone
,
netbook
every
day
and
every
hour
,
and
they
have
eyes
pains
or
headache
.

The
dates
of
postgraduate
were
70
%
at
males
against
30
%
at
females
.

So
that
people
,
who
will
use
the
opportunity
to
go
in
for
sports
will
reduce
the
risk
of
heart
deseases
significantly
.

To
sum
everything
up
,
I
must
admit
that
the
solution
to
the
problem
is
a
mixed
blessing
.

One
of
the
fields
which
were
greatly
affected
by
the
advent
of
technology
is
the
way
of
interaction
and
communication
.

Parents
and
teachers
,
in
their
attempt
to
give
a
proper
education
,
manners
and
behavior
to
teenagers
,
have
reached
the
opposite
thing
-
the
increase
in
the
level
of
crimes
committed
by
them
,
because
breaking
the
law
is
the
protest
agains
exsessive
control
.

Overall
,
it
is
clear
that
the
percentages
of
the
goods
,
delivering
by
different
means
of
transport
,
vary
.

However
,
the
results
of
the
trials
are
withheld
even
from
international
companies
that
spesialize
in
the
analisys
of
data
.

Thus
,
time
management
can
help
to
reduce
this
problem
-
planning
every
hour
.

However
,
other
people
claim
that
government
should
control
and
restrict
the
creative
artist
's
work
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
ratio
of
USA
adults
by
age
group

It
's
million
dollars
and
many
time
.

The
most
popular
trend
between
woman
is
undergraduate
diploma
.

What
is
important
to
say
is
the
diversity
of
sport
facilities
is
not
a
reason
of
improving
the
people
's
health
.

Also
they
can
have
their
own
vast
interests
in
carrying
out
some
researches
.

Also
,
overall
number
of
active
young
ones
was
not
equal
:
there
were
slightly
more
boys
than
girls
in
1990
as
well
as
in
2005
.

As
far
as
creaters
and
producers
are
concerned
,
they
tend
to
chose
working
in
countries
with
strict
rules
and
law
,
which
protect
their
money
.

At
first
,
even
modern
procedures
of
analysis
can
cause
mistakes
.

The
indicator
in
Middle
East
diminished
from
11
%
in
2014
to
9,6
%
in
2015
.

This
somewhat
determines
the
improving
of
public
health
in
the
future
,
when
all
of
these
young
people
will
grow
up
.

Overall
,
after
analysing
the
information
given
,
it
can
be
stated
that
both
minimum
and
maximum
temperatures
in
Russian
city
demonstrate
a
significant
growth
in
summer
months
and
dramatical
decline
in
winter
months
,
while
in
Brazilian
city
minimum
and
maximum
temperatures
flactuate
between
20
and
30
degrees
in
their
summer
months
and
20
and
25
degrees
in
their
winter
month
.

In
conclusion
I
can
say
that
I
can
not
agree
with
the
opinion
that
universities
have
to
accept
equal
quantities
of
male
and
female
applicants
.

As
a
result
of
expressing
freedom
and
ideas
of
creative
artist
we
can
observe
the
development
of
art
.
But
there
are
some
notions
we
should
consider
.

It
is
14,3
per
cent
of
the
whole
population
in
2000
and
11,5
percent
in
2050
.

To
sum
up
,
while
the
first
graph
demonstrates
the
changes
,
the
growth
in
particular
,
of
population
,
the
second
one
represents
birth
rate
and
death
rate
in
the
period
from
1750
till
2000
.

Secondly
,
government
might
overtake
the
whole
air
traveling
sector
and
organise
a
monopoly
on
air
travel
.

It
is
believed
that
a
gap
-
year
is
a
chance
for
students
to
think
once
again
what
career
to
choose
.

Therefore
,
many
people
believe
that
image
of
a
building
is
not
to
be
taken
into
account
and
advice
architecs
to
concentrate
primarly
on
the
functions
of
building
and
neglect
the
cultural
side
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
some
situations
when
only
union
of
countries
can
solve
the
problem
.

Moreover
,
despite
the
common
decrease
,
the
difference
in
Japan
,
the
UK
and
the
USA
is
still
much
bigger
than
the
difference
in
New
Zealand
and
Germany
.

In
my
personal
opinion
,
everything
should
be
balanced
.

Nevertless
,
by
2005
there
had
been
more
overweight
girls
than
overweight
boys
,
with
25
%
and
22
%
in
turn
.

But
according
to
another
opinion
,
countries
should
produce
food
for
their
population
themselves
and
not
to
import
it
.

The
percentage
of
kinds
and
teenagers
will
gradually
go
down
in
Italy
and
will
have
a
more
rapid
regression
in
Yemen
.

Thereby
,
children
tend
to
be
closer
to
their
parents
than
to
anyone
else
.

All
people
need
it
.

Many
fermers
will
start
to
produce
more
because
there
are
not
a
competition
.

In
this
essay
I
am
going
to
examine
the
question
from
both
points
of
view
and
then
give
my
own
opinion
on
the
matter
.

Nowadays
,
some
people
think
that
if
we
can
build
a
lot
of
sport
facilities
in
our
cities
,
public
health
will
be
better
.

However
,
others
believe
they
deserve
to
be
banned
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.

This
is
true
because
of
the
recent
harmful
situations
that
are
taking
place
in
many
countries
.

People
better
learn
and
memorize
things
,
connecting
whith
practise
.

In
conclusion
,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
nowadays
with
illegal
drugs
that
can
be
solved
by
changing
firstly
,
the
system
secondly
,
people
's
(
athlet
's
)
mindset
on
these
issues
.

It
is
the
lifestyle
of
artists
:
be
creative
,
be
freedom
and
do
what
they
wo
nt
.

My
personality
characteristics
and
development
are
changed
.

It
should
be
noted
that
the
persantage
of
people
who
older
than
60
years
old
will
demonstrate
a
global
growth
for
Italy
,
approximately
for
twenty
percent
,
which
as
a
result
decline
the
quantity
of
people
aged
between
fifteen
and
fiftynine
years
old
.

The
largest
kind
of
goods
,
which
were
transported
by
rail
is
metals
,
it
consisted
35
percent
of
total
volume
.

29
%
of
all
men
and
43
%
of
all
women
in
Indonesia
work
in
the
sphere
of
Agriculture
.

In
Japan
,
however
,
the
gap
between
female
and
male
workers
is
wider
-
30
percent
.

Nevertheless
,
one
can
agree
that
free
share
of
music
and
films
should
be
available
for
people
who
do
not
have
opportunities
for
buying
discs
and
tapes
.

The
poems
,
pictures
and
films
also
can
be
the
reason
of
human
anger
to
each
other
or
to
some
small
groups
(
gay
or
lesbian
,
black
-
skined
people
,
vegetarians
and
so
on
)
.

Some
Some
people
people
think
think
that
that
the
the
equal
equal
numbers
numbers
of
of
men
men
and
and
women
women
should
should
be
be
accepted
accepted
by
by
universities
universities
.
.

Our
everyday
lifestyle
has
changed
greatly
during
the
last
30
years
but
learning
systems
in
many
countries
do
not
take
it
into
account
.

So
,
the
question
remains
relevant
:
\"
To
what
extent
such
measure
could
be
effective
?
\"

Moreover
,
that
illegal
medicines
give
more
chances
to
win
for
participants
from
developed
countries
because
they
can
provide
their
athletes
contemporary
drugs
by
modern
techologies
while
developing
countries
can
not
afford
it
because
of
lack
of
money
and
qualificated
scholars
.

The
73
per
cent
of
adults
prefer
to
use
Facebook
.

We
are
living
in
the
century
of
Internet
,
so
for
many
people
copying
and
sharing
files
is
a
daily
routine
.

Unfortunately
this
problem
can
not
be
solved
without
abandoning
distructive
ideology
of
liberalism
.

So
,
this
issue
is
going
to
be
discussed
underneath
.

As
in
the
recent
decades
we
have
become
free
to
choose
the
way
of
earning
a
living
out
a
wide
range
of
jobs
,
earning
money
can
not
be
an
obstacle
to
living
a
full
life
and
vice
versa
.

Manufactured
goods
are
almost
the
same
of
each
category
.

Moderation
is
the
key
to
a
success
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
nowadays
people
are
tended
to
has
many
heath
problems
due
to
the
development
of
modern
tecnology
.

The
private
organisations
today
are
more
likely
to
become
a
sponsor
of
some
scientific
project
.

Or
Kura
Naitly
it
is
very
beautiful
women
and
beeter
in
film
-
play
and
her
too
repead
dificalt
.

To
summarise
,
some
people
prefer
to
ban
athlete
's
activities
because
of
doping
during
2
years
.

The
chart
shows
that
the
percentage
of
people
,
who
did
not
have
a
job
in
North
Africa
stayed
constant
from
2014
to
2015
.

I
think
it
's
because
they
use
a
lot
of
time
and
money
,
and
they
try
to
do
a
good
building
which
will
serve
for
a
long
time
.

First
of
all
,
I
think
that
people
would
more
likely
buy
the
apartments
or
work
in
the
building
they
like
.

The
percentage
of
male
and
female
workers
was
32
%
and
11
%
respectively
.

There
is
a
common
opinion
that
some
of
the
mankind
's
last
inventions
trend
to
have
a
negative
impact
on
our
health
.

Another
opinion
is
that
the
main
school
of
children
's
development
are
places
outside
home
,
which
have
a
great
influence
on
child
's
life
.

As
far
as
the
second
chart
is
concerned
,
the
most
preferrable
country
for
tourism
according
to
englishmen
is
France
(
about
11
mln
of
visitors
in
1999
)
.

The
graph
gives
information
about
the
population
of
people
aged
65
and
over
.

Nowadays
student
behaviour
in
schools
is
one
of
the
most
urgent
problem
of
modern
society
in
different
countries
.

In
conclusion
,
I
can
say
that
the
widespread
use
of
technology
cause
many
healthy
problems
And
the
possible
solution
of
this
situation
is
giving
people
knowledge
about
their
health
and
healthy
lifestyle
and
making
sport
more
popular
.

I
think
,
that
we
need
to
renovate
our
relations
with
gadgets
.

Furthermore
,
in
Indonesia
in
services
work
49
per
cent
of
women
,
on
the
other
hand
,
in
Australia
the
part
of
female
working
in
Services
takes
88
per
cent
.

The
bar
chart
comparies
development
of
the
book
market
in
four
countries
in
2014
with
2018
.

One
more
possible
reason
why
nowadays
juveniles
are
committing
the
crimes
is
that
this
is
a
significant
opportunity
to
get
parents
'
attention
.

First
of
all
,
teacher
must
be
a
good
phsycologist
.

At
the
end
it
gets
almost
28
%
.

To
the
Art
courses
come
600
students
aned
the
45
persent
of
them
are
40
years
old
and
above
.

They
have
the
same
predictions
about
the
increasing
of
number
of
people
,
who
are
60
+
years
.

However
,
there
is
a
slow
decline
which
begins
in
February
and
finished
in
July
with
the
lowest
temperatures
,
namely
about
+18
°
C
for
min
temperature
and
exactly
20
°
C
for
maximum
one
.

On
the
contrary
,
they
have
some
goals
,
which
are
connected
with
career
and
money
.

The
possible
way
of
solution
is
to
limit
usage
of
gadgets
.

Meanwhile
,
although
earnings
of
Japanese
citizens
were
also
decreasing
over
the
given
15
year
period
,
reach
the
unlimate
peak
of
42
percent
in
the
80
-
ties
,
and
stayed
the
leader
in
1995
at
30
.

You
can
not
recovery
from
illness
only
with
love
.

One
kind
of
such
theft
is
the
pirate
copying
of
music
and
films
.

As
for
North
Africa
,
the
unemployment
rate
stabled
.

In
July
it
raise
down
from
30
°
C
to
25
.

Certainly
,
I
ca
n't
disagree
with
this
statement
.

Otherwise
,
Germany
had
a
dramatic
downshift
to
the
year
1990
,
whan
the
percentage
of
the
income
of
the
people
was
10
percent
,
but
than
the
earnings
of
the
population
started
to
grow
and
a
get
a
high
of
approximately
13
percent
to
1995
.

In
my
firm
belief
,
we
must
stop
it
before
it
is
too
late
.

Kids
should
be
taught
about
good
and
bad
from
the
very
young
age
,
and
they
should
feel
that
they
are
cared
about
.

If
the
building
serves
its
purpose
,
but
is
also
beautiful
,
it
is
not
a
problem
.

Someone
is
think
that
life
experiences
play
a
big
role
in
our
development
,
but
research
shows
that
personal
characteristics
depend
from
with
what
we
are
born
with
.

Firstly
,
architecture
as
an
art
is
a
way
to
both
house
certain
social
structures
,
whether
it
is
families
or
factories
,
and
shape
sociological
conditions
,
as
argued
by
Richard
Sennett
and
Richard
J
Williams
in
their
respective
works
.

Consequently
,
we
can
not
ignore
this
aspect
.

Moreover
,
parents
need
to
buy
books
about
nature
and
geographical
explorations
and
read
them
with
their
children
as
that
is
also
key
factor
of
a
child
educational
problem
.

The
biggest
advantage
here
is
freedom
of
conscisness
.

In
winter
,
the
demand
for
electricity
increases
in
the
late
night
hours
to
approximately
40,000
units
at
2
-
3
a.m.
;
then
it
declines
steadily
and
at
7
-
8
hours
in
the
morning
makes
up
nearly
30,000
units
.

However
,
there
are
some
people
who
argue
that
sport
training
is
not
enough
for
our
sustainable
health
.

The
same
tendency
to
Middle
East
can
be
observed
in
Latin
America
.

The
line
of
minimum
in
Yakutsk
reached
a
peak
in
July
at
the
point
of
+10
degrees
.

The
materials
now
are
not
cheap
.

But
one
of
them
(
by
rail
)
is
more
used
for
metals
'
transportation
,
whily
road
is
more
used
for
food
transportation
.

Percent
of
old
people
(
more
60
years
)
is
biger
in
Italy
;
in
Yemen
their
number
will
rise
,
but
it
still
small
.

Secondly
internet
becomes
very
pooular
nowadays
and
any
artist
can
loud
their
creation
in
this
global
network
.

While
the
West
world
is
more
self
-
centered
,
the
Eestern
is
all
about
collective
values
.

We
know
that
Asian
countries
are
famous
for
their
extraordinary
spicy
dishes
.

However
,
there
the
rate
is
accounted
for
3.9
%
in
both
years
.

As
can
be
seen
from
the
graph
,
the
unemployment
rate
in
N.
Africa
maintained
at
the
same
level
at
12,5
%
.

This
feeling
is
unforgettable
and
brings
you
many
positive
emotions
.

It
is
clear
that
more
girls
are
intrested
in
arts
than
boys
and
there
are
more
boys
in
the
faculty
of
physics
than
girls
.

The
percentage
of
old
people
will
increase
up
to
more
than
a
third
past
of
population
.

A
good
example
of
this
is
illegal
release
of
the
final
episode
of
the
BBC
's
drama
\"
Sherlock
\"
.

The
essay
will
discuss
both
views
and
provide
arguments
.

From
my
point
of
view
there
is
no
need
to
establish
equal
number
of
male
and
female
students
in
a
group
.

Transport
is
one
of
the
most
important
parts
of
our
everyday
activity
,
it
has
been
a
necessity
for
many
years
.

The
main
problem
of
its
using
is
weakness
of
health
system
,
particularly
heart
problem
.

Some
clips
and
video
is
awful
.

Nevertheless
,
recent
researches
have
proved
that
facing
objects
of
art
makes
people
feel
happier
.

The
number
of
women
and
men
who
had
bachelor
's
degree
is
almost
the
some
,
it
is
about
53
per
cent
and
46
per
cent
respectively
.

Speaking
about
Rio
-
de
-
Janeiro
,
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
approximately
remain
the
same
level
between
15
and
30
degrees
above
zero
the
whole
year
.

A
close
look
at
data
helps
to
notice
that
the
youngest
ones
spend
a
lot
of
time
to
do
sport
and
the
oldest
ones
spend
a
very
few
time
doing
exercises
.

A
person
,
who
have
never
done
any
sports
doubtfully
might
be
motivated
only
by
a
new
sport
center
by
his
house
.

From
2000
the
percentage
of
elderly
people
in
Sweden
began
to
rise
to
20
per
cent
.

To
sum
it
up
,
all
undergrounds
has
specific
characteristics
,
some
of
them
are
long
old
instead
of
others
which
are
young
and
only
going
to
become
large
undergrounds
.

They
believe
that
the
fear
of
long
enough
sentence
will
prevent
people
from
commiting
crimes
as
the
risk
will
be
not
worth
it
.

In
that
case
such
economical
behavior
will
lead
to
various
vital
disputes
in
society
.

That
's
why
we
can
say
that
genetic
influence
on
us
is
more
powerful
.

In
Italy
61,6
%
people
aged
from
15
-
59
years
.

Also
,
the
difference
between
minimum
and
maximum
temperatures
seems
to
be
higher
in
summer
(
10
degrees
)
than
in
winter
(
about
7
degrees
)
.

Moreover
,
they
should
be
allowed
to
choose
the
program
they
want
to
study
by
themselves
and
any
restrictions
in
this
way
are
inacceptable
.

By
the
way
,
in
rural
households
in
1999
the
percentage
of
people
,
who
has
an
access
to
the
Internet
was
very
small
,
but
by
2004
it
increases
by
35
%
.

Instead
of
building
new
sport
center
government
can
give
money
to
the
decreasing
of
industrial
pollution
or
greening
city
.

It
can
be
cause
to
untrust
them
and
their
reform
.

According
to
some
psychological
and
sociological
theories
,
like
Massons
pyramide
in
instance
,
a
person
should
,
firstly
,
fullfill
his
or
her
vital
,
primal
needs
in
heat
,
safety
and
comfort
and
only
after
it
come
about
higher
ones
.

At
the
time
between
approximately
6,30
amd
21
hours
it
is
noticeable
the
rising
to
more
then
40,000
units
and
reaching
the
peak
after
21
o'clock
.

Firstly
,
it
is
the
governments
'
responsibility
to
step
up
when
a
world
-
wide
issue
has
reached
a
crucial
condition
.

Reffering
to
summirise
information
about
two
charts
,
employers
support
young
people
who
aims
to
make
a
career
and
be
successful
in
their
work
.

The
problem
with
technology
is
that
most
innovations
have
unintended
consequences
and
unintended
consequences
are
causig
harm
and
creating
dangers
of
existental
magnitude
.

In
conclusion
,
I
can
say
that
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
is
much
more
stable
,
than
in
Yakutsk
.

It
's
agreed
that
copying
and
sharing
original
media
content
is
illegal
.

Firstly
,
because
the
amount
of
cars
are
higher
than
the
amount
of
air
planes
.

Unfortunately
,
if
the
sportsman
will
fail
again
,
we
ban
him
forever
.

As
a
result
,
we
have
problems
with
our
healthy
.

The
university
education
is
very
popular
nowadays
among
young
people
of
both
sexes
.

As
a
result
of
this
they
can
start
engage
in
crime
or
kill
.

Also
it
can
be
seen
that
the
graphs
for
all
these
countries
are
decreasing
throughout
the
whole
period
from
1980
to
1995
.

In
In
January
January
in
in
Yakutsk
Yakutsk
the
the
temperature
temperature
is
is
-
-
40
40
°
°
C
C
.
.

While
India
has
reached
only
almost
three
quarters
of
that
level
by
now
,
speed
of
growth
of
its
level
is
generally
higher
.

It
is
very
difficult
to
stay
long
term
inspired
without
money
.

There
are
some
cases
,
when
sportsmen
were
treated
with
drugs
by
their
trainers
or
even
doctors
without
even
understending
it
.

In
conclusion
,
I
want
to
say
,
that
I
support
point
of
view
,
that
we
must
eat
native
foods
and
it
can
help
us
to
stay
healtful
.

So
,
the
other
actual
problem
is
how
law
norms
can
regulate
the
process
of
spreading
of
this
content
and
how
it
can
influence
the
illegal
business
and
should
be
the
users
of
pirate
content
punished
.

The
biggest
differense
of
percantage
is
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

In
USA
this
number
will
fall
from
10,5
to
8,5
billion
dollars
by
2018
.

As
it
can
be
seen
from
the
graph
from
1940
to
the
begining
of
2000
the
proportion
of
population
aged
66
and
over
in
Japan
was
about
3
-
5
%
.

In
this
essay
I
will
present
some
causes
and
solutions
to
this
problem
.

Although
to
the
March
of
2013
users
'
preferences
have
not
reaaly
changed
,
the
ratio
of
those
using
mobile
version
increased
from
being
just
over
50
millions
in
2012
to
almost
100
millions
in
2013
.

First
and
foremost
,
the
Internet
is
a
free
platform
,
where
people
can
get
in
touch
and
share
information
with
each
other
.

One
of
the
biggest
problem
is
that
due
to
the
development
such
phenominen
as
Internet
,
people
become
much
lazier
,
which
lead
to
the
problems
with
weight
.

At
this
day
and
age
the
entire
society
is
driven
by
goals
,
dreams
and
cravings
.

According
to
the
graph
the
unemployment
rate
decreased
in
the
Middle
East
from
11
to
9,6
%
and
in
Latin
America
from
6,8
to
5,8
%
correspondingly
.

People
were
given
free
living
space
,
which
is
an
unarguable
benefit
,
but
once
they
got
a
possibility
to
move
to
another
place
they
did
since
no
one
wants
to
live
in
an
ugly

box
.

And
his
music
has
changed
and
changes
the
lives
of
enormous
number
of
people
.

However
However

.

It
stayed
at
the
level
of
3,9
%
.

Each
solution
,
whether
it
is
providing
the
whole
awareness
of
children
that
crimes
are
illegal
,
or
whether
it
is
about
increasing
the
controlling
of
the
therritory
.

In
my
opinion
,
because
if
the
equal
quantity
of
male
and
female
in
university
was
,
it
means
,
that
our
community
would
have
many
bad
and
unprofessional
workers
,
because
if
you
do
not
like
to
do
anything
,
in
many
cases
,
you
do
it
worse
than
if
you
like
to
do
.

Problems
with
memory
and
attention
are
developing
because
of
link
system
and
the
huge
volume
of
information
.

Overall
,
in
2000
,
14
years
consisted
just
over
half
of
all
population
in
Yemen
,
while
in
Italy
they
were
only
14,3
%
.

By
the
beginning
of
this
millenium
these
countries
had
relatively
different
population
age
structures
.

Second
,
out
personal
characteristics
remain
in
our
private
life
.

Furthermore
,
official
content
costs
a
lot
,
for
instance
,
a
single
album
or
movie
can
reach
10
dollars
or
even
higher
in
price
.

It
was
the
competition
,
in
which
you
can
prove
and
check
yourself
.

Some
people
talk
about
destiny
of
every
person
.

For
example
,
there
are
new
types
of
boots
that
help
to
run
longer
and
faster
in
any
weather
condition
.

However
,
the
decrease
happens
in
European
countries
,
such
as
France
and
Sweden
.

The
development
of
farms
and
food
factories
had
a
strong
negative
impact
on
ecology
.

Indonesia
's
frmale
workers
had
a
drop
and
just
49
per
cent
.

The
rate
of
metals
is
35
%
,
that
is
the
highest
proportion
among
goods
transported
by
rail
.

Otherwise
,
they
will
also
provide
a
bad
impact
on
our
health
.

What
is
more
,
these
rates
remained
the
same
in
the
next
year
,
as
well
as
the
percentage
of
non
-
working
people
worldwide
,
which
was
about
5,9
%
.

For
this
aim
big
and
medium
-
sized
cities
have
a
huge
range
of
sports
clubs
.

It
is
approximately
90
percent
,
although
for
women
it
was
only
around
ten
percent
.

Probably
this
can
help
us
to
understand
why
we
have
impulsive
grow
of
demand
on
11
A.
M.
Probably
housewifes
is
cleaning
their
homes
in
the
morning
.

All
sources
of
builders
should
be
directed
to
the
proper
constructing
and
planing
of
the
house
.

In
conclusion
we
can
say
that
in
both
countries
there
is
a
tendency
to
have
less
children
but
at
the
same
time
,
life
and
medicine
become
better
and
more
satisfactory
for
population
as
old
people
tend
to
live
longer
.

The
illustrations
demonstrate
proportions
of
goods
transported
by
rail
and
by
road
between
Eastern
Europe
countries
in
2008
.

However
,
there
are
also
three
regions
where
the
unemployment
rate
changed
.

Many
people
claim
that
artist
should
have
absolute
freedom
is
the
way
they
create
and
express
their
understanding
of
the
world
and
government
shoukd
be
forbidden
to
influent
this
sphere
.

Moreover
,
every
year
the
impact
of
climate
change
increases
.

Although
,
its
advocates
see
more
advantages
than
drawbacks
.

So
why
should
we
let
internet
thefs
commit
their
crimes
and
more
?

Art
often
becomes
a
sense
of
life
for
people
,
they
feel
happy
only
if
they
create
something
.

It
can
help
for
people
,
and
also
it
predict
bad
habits
of
teenagers
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
stress
that
our
life
is
not
very
long
,
we
can
not
sit
and
wait
for
magic
.

Part
of
the
population
may
dislike
the
native
food
.

What
is
more
,
the
most
popular
area
of
employment
was
the
spheare
of
services
.

They
visited
fitness
clubs
to
do
different
sports
exersice
.

Last
but
not
least
,
the
opposite
opinion
is
that
cultural
products
such
as
movies
or
music
sould
be
free
for
all
of
people
and
it
is
partly
right
for
me
.

The
amount
of
Yemen
's
people
from
60
years
in
2050
will
less
than
amount
of
Italy
's
people
of
the
same
age
:
5,7
%
against
42,3
%
.

First
of
all
,
it
goes
without
saying
that
climate
conditions
can
not
allow
people
from
different
countries
consume
all
nescessary
products
for
maintaining
good
health
and
successful
daily
life
.

They
are
ugly
,
they
do
n't
catch
an
eye
of
man
,
but
they
perfectly
matched
their
purpose
-
to
give
flats
to
Soviet
residents
.

Yes
,
it
can
be
effective
,
they
can
realize
what
they
have
done
,
but
they
can
think
if
they
killed
one
person
and
do
not
have
prison
sentences
,
they
will
can
kill
another
person
and
will
not
have
a
punishment
.

Winter
season
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
however
,
is
the
hottest
time
of
the
year
,
reaching
30
°
C
.
Average
temperature
in
Brazil
only
slightly
drops
to
about
25
°
-19
°
C
mid
-
year
with
the
absolute
maximum
being
close
+17
°
C
,
the
temperature
only
barely
reached
in
Yakutsk
's
hottest
month
,
July
.

The
root
of
the
problem
is
the
decrease
of
the
opportunities
for
small
businesses
.

This
tendency
is
caused
by
a
range
of
reasons
and
social
problems
,
that
still
exist
in
our
society
.

What
are
the
reasons
for
spreading
illegal
pirat
copies
among
Internet
users
?

Also
amount
of
people
in
age
from
15
to
59
years
will
be
increase
in
Yemen
for
20
%
and
discrease
in
Italy
for
25
%
.

So
governoment
and
people
themselves
should
pay
more
attention
to
possible
ways
of
improving
motivation
of
human
being
to
follow
healthy
lifestyle
.

Method
of
accepting
students
which
consist
of
equal
places
both
for
males
and
females
can
lead
to
some
undesirable
consequences
.

Nowadays
in
lots
of
families
both
parents
have
a
job
and
pay
less
time
to
their
children
.

We
can
see
that
the
largest
percantage
among
males
is
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

There
was
no
any
changes
between
2014
and
next
year
.

That
's
why
,
it
is
neessary
to
find
out
all
pros
and
cons
and
than
decide
what
is
better
for
you
.

Still
there
are
pieces
of
art
that
can
easily
hurt
someone
's
feelings
or
are
simply
disgusting
.

The
pie
chart
gives
the
options
for
the
reason
of
electricity
demand
in
the
same
location
.

Born
characteristics
is
important
fact
for
our
development
,
but
only
when
they
use
correct
,
with
mind
.

In
our
everyday
life
we
are
connected
with
a
huge
amount
of
technologies
which
are
,
on
the
one
hand
,
make
our
life
easier
,
but
on
the
other
hand
,
case
a
lot
of
problem
with
our
health
.

In
this
section
women
prevalied
at
70
%
instead
of
men
whose
their
figure
peacked
at
40
%
.

As
the
followers
of
the
theory
,
that
family
plays
the
biggest
part
in
a
child
's
development
,
the
following
life
is
only
about
shaping
and
'
decorationg
'
yorself
.

By
contrast
,
UK
take
the
last
position
amounting
2,6
billion
,
which
was
five
times
less
than
in
USA
.

As
a
result
of
the
communacation
with
the
friends
like
that
,
children
become
to
be
like
them
.

From
1985
-
1990
percentage
of
fat
girls
was
more
that
the
boys
,
while
in
2000
-
2005
the
country
has
more
overweight
boys
than
girls
.

There
are
people
who
claim
that
earning
more
money
is
more
vital
rather
then
their
leisure
time
.

On
the
other
hand
,
in
Italy
according
to
predictions
there
will
be
a
dramatic
fall
in
the
quantity
of
15
-
59
years
old
people
.

Today
world
presents
as
a
great
variety
of
hobbies
and
poeple
can
do
almost
any
they
like
.

How
individuals
try
to
solve
this
type
of
problem
.

The
highest
temperature
in
Russian
city
in
July
,
is
about
20
°
C
,
whereas
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
in
January
,
is
about
30
°
C
.

Therefore
it
is
very
easy
to
find
the
possibility
to
do
sports
nowadays
.

Eventually
,
doing
different
exersizes
,
we
will
have
more
muscles
and
our
bones
will
be
broken
less
.

However
,
nobody
knows
what
is
happiness
and
how
to
become
happy
.

This
rule
is
enough
for
the
realisation
of
the
principle
mentioned
above
.

For
instance
,
many
people
are
too
busy
to
spend
long
hours
to
get
to
any
kind
of
fitness
clubs
.

Artists
must
to
have
freedom
for
their
creativites
,
otherwise
it
will
not
useful
for
their
,
because
probably
they
can
do
something
really
attractive
,
impressive
and
wonderful
,
but
if
it
will
banned
people
will
not
know
about
it
.

So
let
us
have
a
closer
look
on
this
problem
.

Some
people
believe
,
that
increasing
the
number
of
sports
faculties
can
solve
this
problem
.

In
this
essay
I
am
going
to
discuss
why
copying
and
sharing
music
and
films
is
a
fraud
.

Some
people
think
that
this
is
really
effective
to
produce
food
and
export
it
to
over
countries
.

But
from
anoter
point
of
view
London
subway
is
only
at
the
third
position
by
popularity
.

Meanwhile
in
worldwide
a
quantity
of
unemployment
people
stabilized
at
5,9
per
cent
in
2014
and
2015
.

Moreover
,
it
is
believed
that
people
's
brain
opportunities
are
different
,
for
instanse
,
some
people
have
no
problem
with
Maths
,
other
people
have
to
make
an
effort
to
solute
a
mathimatical
task
.

The
main
conclusion
that
could
be
made
of
lookin
at
this
data
is
the
stability
of
the
world
's
unemployment
issue
.

So
,
that
means
that
these
products
can
be
easily
transported
in
both
ways
.

In
the
end
I
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
win
over
the
pirates
and
punishing
is
not
one
of
them
.

It
went
from
11
to
9,6
points
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
it
also
went
down
from
6,8
to
5,8
points
in
the
Latin
America
.

Why
do
we
punish
the
first
group
of
people
and
ignore
The
second
one
?

Children
always
prefer
to
adopt
adult
's
outlook
on
life
and
behaviour
as
well
.

Summarising
preceding
arguments
,
the
population
of
Yemen
will
be
mostly
middle
-
aged
by
2050
,
while
the
part
of
older
people
will
remain
stable
at
just
under
6
percent
rate
.

And
for
the
road
transport
,
food
products
were
transported
mostly
.

That
is
why
story
,
when
a
child
with
axe
murders
family
for
prohibiting
playing
computer
,
exists
.

But
as
for
men
there
was
a
decline
to
39
%
.
this
percentage
was
equal
to
the
using
Facebook
for
receiving
updates
for
both
men
and
women
.

Less
time
should
be
spent
in
front
of
the
computer
,
business
discussion
can
be
conducted
in
person
instead
of
Skype
conferences
.

In
all
graphs
maximum
and
minimum
temperature
in
the
mid
of
year
.

Schools
should
employ
specialists
to
help
students
in
solving
these
problems
.

The
unemployment
rate
in
the
European
Union
was
significantly
lower
than
in
North
Africa
and
the
Middle
East
.

Another
point
is
that
some
kinds
of
drugs
are
included
in
medicines
which
injured
sportsmen
have
to
take
in
order
to
restore
their
health
and
sport
society
knows
examples
when
these
medicines
were
detected
as
drugs
.

This
graph
illustrates
the
number
of
the
population
aged
65
and
over
between
1940
and
2040
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
USA
.

In
this
essay
I
will
try
to
illuminate
both
views
and
join
one
of
the
sides
.

In
Italy
there
is
more
olders
than
teens
and
this
number
will
increase
in
projection
.

First
and
foremost
,
our
parents
nurture
us
,
show
how
to
behave
,
how
to
cope
with
a
huge
problems
in
our
life
and
how
to
build
own
family
.

Last
,
but
not
least
argument
is
that
reducing
the
amount
of
import
will
significantly
harm
the
economy
.
it
is
clear
that
this
trade
between
countries
would
have
only
positive
impact
on
both
countries
which
participate
in
it
.

For
example
,
there
is
no
big
difference
in
the
qualification
of
man
who
had
studied
the
economy
with
the
woman
and
of
one
other
who
had
done
it
without
them
.

If
the
goverment
decided
to
increase
the
number
of
sports
facilities
it
does
not
mean
that
all
people
decided
to
go
in
for
sport
:
some
of
them
,
moreover
,
are
not
able
to
do
it
.

However
,
others
do
not
believe
that
it
is
effeictive
and
they
say
that
other
measures
are
required
.

Moreover
,
a
huge
amount
of
people
should
be
involved
in
this
process
.

Amount
of
transported
chemicals
and
food
products
are
equal
and
machinery
is
ahead
of
them
only
with
one
per
cent
more
.

It
is
an
urgent
problem
of
our
contemporary
society
.

However
,
the
figures
for
all
the
other
age
groups
are
poor
,
with
25
%
,
11
%
and
6
%
respectively
.

The
second
part
of
the
chart
illustrates
the
difference
between
the
percentage
of
men
and
women
using
Facebook
for
the
particular
reason
.

However
,
I
stick
to
the
opinion
that
this
measures
should
not
be
done
.

It
is
important
to
understand
how
to
fight
it
,
and
that
is
why
we
need
to
point
out
the
possible
reasons
of
the
trend
.

The
huge
part
of
our
society
think
that
it
was
right
desicion
.

If
a
person
is
misjudged
somehow
,
he
can
prove
his
innocence
,
and
the
lack
of
evidence
can
also
be
a
reason
for
innocence
.

The
statement
that
more
crimes
are
being
commited
by
young
people
is
not
absolute
.

From
the
given
table
we
can
see
the
tendehcy
of
growing
of
doing
regular
physical
activity
among
the
children
.

As
for
me
,
I
am
convinced
that
family
and
the
outside
world
do
both
have
a
priority
in
different
time
periods
of
human
developement
.

There
are
numerous
flaws
in
their
economical
,
political
and
social
policy
which
is
in
need
to
be
renovated
,
renewed
and
reconsidered
.

Despite
this
,
import
have
beneficial
adventage
.

Almost
all
regions
show
positive
changes
(
Middle
East
,
Latin
America
)
or
do
not
show
changes
at
all
(
North
Africa
,
South
Asia
or
Worldwide
)
however
there
is
only
one
region
that
demonstrates
negative
change
in
unemployment
rate
.

Then
since
2003
for
2004
the
percentage
of
rural
connection
raised
for
10
%
each
year
.

But
children
0
-
14
years
fall
on
13,1
%
on
compare
with
2000
.

Such
knowledge
include
communication
skills
with
another
gender
,
and
the
easiest
to
get
them
is
to
be
a
member
of
a
class
,
where
there
are
an
equal
number
of
boys
and
girls
.

The
graph
for
the
Japan
started
at
7
%
and
it
had
the
same
tendency
for
growth
as
the
figure
for
Americans
untill
1980
.

The
city
has
all
four
weather
seasons
,
while
the
temreture
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
is
never
less
then
15
digree
.

In
this
essay
I
will
outline
the
causes
of
increased
crime
rates
among
teenagers
and
offer
several
solutions
to
eradicate
the
problem
.

Their
reasons
are
that
in
this
time
people
can
get
a
lot
of
experience
for
their
future
study
and
work
.

This
points
stayed
stable
in
this
period
of
time
.

The
USSR
is
a
great
example
of
those
restrictions
for
artists
.

In
the
modern
world
the
situation
was
changed
and
both
girls
and
boys
study
at
school
and
in
the
university
,
but
the
number
of
female
and
male
students
is
often
unequal
:
for
example
,
in
the
Philology
department
there
are
significantly
more
girls
,
but
,
in
contrast
,
in
the
department
of
Economics
the
number
of
male
students
is
higher
.

This
essay
will
observe
this
situation
and
give
examples
.

These
wide
range
of
problems
can
be
decreased
by
human
efforts
.

To
sum
up
,
there
are
different
points
of
view
on
this
issue
but
I
would
say
that
disadvantages
of
spending
money
on
space
exploration
outweigh
its
advatages
.

Also
pirate
copies
can
help
people
became
noticed
.

The
second
graph
demonstrates
the
birth
and
death
rates
both
gradually
falling
down
through
years
,
birth
rate
staying
higher
than
death
one
.

Secondly
,
multinational
brands
often
produce
products
which
are
made
with
the
world
standarts
,
so
you
can
be
sure
in
consumption
of
good
products
.

The
bar
-
chart
illustrates
the
market
of
eBook
and
print
in
Germany
,
the
USA
,
China
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
in
2014
and
predictions
of
it
in
2018
.

There
is
a
peak
of
used
electricity
at
22:00
in
winter
,
meanwhile
in
summer
there
is
the
highest
point
from
12
to
15
.

The
percentage
of
users
fluctuates
from
22
to
31
per
cent
,
while
the
fourth
and
the
first
visit
this
site
with
equal
frequency
.

What
it
means
for
them
to
be
happy
?

Moreover
,
people
can
begin
eat
healthy
food
in
time
and
work
on
the
laptop
.

Various
research
has
been
carried
out
to
demonstrate
the
direct
influence
of
the
landscape
on
emotional
state
of
an
individual
.

These
people
believe
that
the
school
knowledge
,
for
example
,
is
much
more
better
for
development
of
their
children
's
mind
than
lifetime
experience
.

In
this
essay
I
would
look
at
this
issu
at
different
angles
.

Also
,
that
is
due
to
the
fact
that
more
children
are
born
in
Japan
,
and
as
a
result
,
they
take
up
some
'
space
'
in
the
generations
division
.

Most
in
prison
are
sentenced
for
robbery
,
drugs
,
domestic
violence
.

After
years
of
war
with
all
artists
of
this
kind
,
the
government
of
the
most
cities
on
Earth
gave
the
special
parts
of
city
the
most
talented
and
wel
-
known
street
artists
.

But
,
essentially
,
it
is
argued
that
this
issue
is
discussion
for
humankind
.

More
than
that
,
it
is
significant
for
governments
and
manufacturers
to
consider
and
solve
ecological
problems
that
are
the
top
reason
for
incurable
diseases
.

As
for
the
middle
age
,
the
support
of
employer
for
them
is
small
.

Moreover
,
they
show
that
to
become
successful
and
rich
it
is
necessary
to
bluff
.

Going
back
to
China
it
is
clear
,
that
in
1970
they
had
more
than
a
half
of
energy
from
fossils
,
then
it
increased
slightly
and
in
2015
it
was
the
highest
amount
among
mentioned
5
countries
(
approximately
90
per
cent
)
.

General
population
in
Britain
consisted
of
88
percent
of
white
citizens
and
only
of
12
percent
of
black
ones
.

Parents
and
teachers
ask
physchologists
for
help
hoping
that
these
specialists
will
give
answer
-
why
do
some
students
behave
not
so
great
?

The
way
how
to
minimize
this
risk
was
found
.

All
people
have
to
be
used
to
the
process
since
youth
.

In
general
,
the
percentage
of
obese
boys
and
girls
has
increased
over
the
period
given
.
in
addition
,
boys
tend
to
be
more
physical
active
compared
to
girls
in
the
both
years
.

In
recent
years
the
problem
of
illegal
drugs
in
sport
has
become
very
acute
.

Then
the
level
of
students
started
increasing
slightly
:
from
approximately
30
%
(
at
30
-
39
)
to
around
40
%
at
the
age
of
over
49
.

That
is
why
the
government
and
all
the
people
should
think
and
maybe
invent
something
new
and
unusual
to
make
every
person
starting
taking
care
of
his
health
.

As
can
be
seen
women
holding
a
skilled
vocation
diploma
were
vastly
outnumbered
bymen
with
90
%
of
men
and
10
%
of
women
.

Second
significant
point
is
unpopularity
of
electronic
books
in
China
:
the
benefit
from
selling
them
will
increase
twice
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
is
going
to
stay
the
lowest
one
with
its
figures
0,5
and
1
billion
dollars
in
2014
and
2018
respectively
.

To
conclude
,
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
the
proportion
of
transported
goods
.

What
is
more
,
the
demand
of
electricity
reachs
the
peak
at
11
PM
in
winter
and
in
2
PM
in
summer
.

Indeed
there
are
some
exeptions
in
which
children
of
unwell
parents
turn
out
to
be
grow
up
as
successful
individuals
,
who
had
a
duty
of
their
own
,
a
stable
income
and
permanent
partners
.

First
of
all
,
people
should
create
plan
or
limists
for
technology
and
after
that
they
can
use
tat
or
technology
will
dangerous
for
them
,
on
the
one
hand
.

Private
researches
save
state
's
money
for
people
's
needs
and
give
scintists
a
chance
to
conduct
researches
in
improved
conditions
.

Summarizing
preceding
arguments
,
the
population
of
15
-
59
years
will
increase
in
Yemen
,
whereas
in
Italy
their
number
will
decline
.

I
think
the
try
have
equal
-
numbered
maled
and
femaled
courses
is
crashing
down
,
because
of
this
fact
.

Tokio
with
nearly
2000
passengers
have
only
200
kilometres
of
routes
which
is
worse
than
in
London
when
for
775
passengers
there
is
around
400
kilometres
of
route
.

Inspite
of
watching
TV
,
they
can
go
and
play
football
.

It
is
clear
from
the
graph
that
the
USA
had
the
most
developed
market
.

The
bar
charts
provide
DATA
about
ebook
and
print
book
developing
in
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
UK
in
2014
and
make
expecting
on
2018
.

The
chart
has
five
aspects
:
skilled
vocational
diploma
,
undergraduate
diploma
,
bachelor
's
degree
,
postgraduate
diploma
,
master
's
degree
.

The
underground
route
in
London
is
by
for
the
longest
,
while
Tokyo
subway
provides
the
highest
amount
of
oassengers
by
transport
per
year
.

On
the
one
hand
-
when
in
class
teacher
had
the
same
proportion
of
both
sex
-
it
's
a
good
posibility
to
work
with
gender
differences
in
different
areas
of
science
-
because
there
will
be
a
lot
of
opinions
from
both
sides
.

Of
course
nobody
can
be
happy
forever
,
but
people
must
not
want
to
surfer
.

Some
juveniles
have
very
strict
parents
who
prohibite
eating
sweets
,
coming
home
late
and
stealing
.

It
is
clear
from
the
charts
that
the
most
popular
attraction
for
youngsters
is
lessons
in
science
,
constituing
55
per
cent
of
total
respondents
whereas
art
lessons
are
the
second
most
popular
course
with
30
per
cent
of
visitors
.

In
both
Kyoto
and
Los
Angeles
approximately
50
millions
people
use
subway
every
year
.

The
information
on
the
ages
of
the
populations
of
Yemen
is
differently
from
Italy
.

The
graphs
below
represent
an
infotmation
on
the
amount
of
Facebook
users
from
2012
to
2013
and
the
information
on
the
most
important
reasons
for
using
it
.

Why
is
it
so
?

The
graph
illustrates
the
percentage
in
1999
of
after
graduating
property
betwee
Australians
genders
.

What
is
more
,
architects
choose
this
profession
because
they
have
endless
imagination
,
so
just
let
them
use
it
in
their
projects
.

In
contrast
,
the
UK
had
rather
stable
development
in
both
areas
in
2014
and
in
2018
.

Swarms
of
people
are
attracted
to
architectural
feats
all
over
the
world
,
travelling
long
distances
and
spending
large
sums
just
to
be
able
to
see
it
in
real
life
.

Both
line
graphs
illustrate
the
average
temperature
in
two
cities
,
Yakutsk
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

To
begin
with
,
the
highest
demand
for
winter
is
at
twenty
one
o'clock
and
units
near
fourty
five
thouthand
.

As
a
result
,
the
part
of
old
people
is
going
to
get
smaller
on
almost
twenty
percent
.

Generally
,
this
statistics
says
that
some
types
of
goods
are
mostly
transported
by
trains
and
some
by
LGUs
,
HGUs
,
motor
lorries
etc
.

The
lines
of
the
graph
demonstrate
us
a
change
of
temperatures
during
the
year
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

Is
it
OK
,
that
child
singing
russian
rap
?

How
we
can
to
improve
it
?

So
,
as
a
result
,
the
prices
would
stay
on
the
same
level
and
the
demand
will
be
realning
new
peats
.

Besides
,
there
are
things
that
sould
be
solved
as
fast
as
it
possible
,
but
there
is
a
question
:
what
is
more
important
to
invest
in
?

To
conclude
all
information
,
it
is
necessary
to
claim
,
that
the
government
can
find
the
good
solution
for
the
problem
of
spending
time
indoors
among
children
.
every
country
can
offer
the
interesing
programmes
.

The
import
of
the
food
tend
to
be
an
important
part
of
many
countries
'
economy
.

The
tourists
are
actually
interested
in
the
history
of
the
country
,
they
are
ready
to
pay
for
all
museums
and
sightseeings
,
thus
it
makes
profit
to
the
goverment
budget
.

There
is
only
one
reason
.

We
can
also
see
that
the
amount
of
Facebook
users
increase
,
because
there
were
overall
200
users
per
March
2012
and
about
220
users
in
March
2013
.

Such
accidents
lead
to
terrible
pollution
which
harms
people
and
nature
.

As
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
I
strongly
feel
that
experiences
which
we
have
in
our
life
have
more
influence
on
our
personality
and
development
than
characteristics
which
people
took
when
they
were
born
as
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
for
it
.

In
1970
these
countries
had
82
%
,
90
%
and
95
%
each
,
however
,
in
2015
Sweden
and
France
reached
the
number
of
25
%
and
48
%
each
.

Other
Underground
railway
system
I
want
to
write
in
order
of
date
opened
:
Paris
,
Tokyo
,
Washington
DC
and
Kyoto
URS
,
so
they
were
opened
in
1900
.
1927
,
1976
and
finally
1981
.

It
's
enough
to
make
athlet
think
twice
but
there
is
a
chance
to
prove
their
right
for
sport
.

To
sum
up
it
can
be
said
that
happy
is
something
that
everybody
try
to
get
during
whole
life
.

Only
6
%
of
all
products
transported
by
rail
were
non
-
metallic
minerals
.

In
Rio
de
Janeiro
the
temprature
in
July
constituted
25
°
and
18
°
respectively
,
whereas
in
January
the
highest
temprature
made
up
30
°
.

In
conclusion
,
this
table
shows
that
works
of
different
region
of
unemployment
are
falling
down
or
stay
the
same
.

However
,
there
is
a
heating
debate
on
a
topic
whether
government
should
try
to
help
people
only
in
their
country
or
all
around
the
world
.

In
conclusion
,
with
banning
athelets
who
break
the
law
should
be
banned
.

Not
each
musician
,
film
director
or
writer
concider
that
those
who
downloads
files
illegaly
should
go
to
jail
.

Nowadays
,
the
cheeting
in
sport
connecting
with
illegal
drugs
is
becoming
widespread
problem
.

How
can
the
society
try
to
solve
this
problem
?

A
lot
of
people
watch
TV
,
surf
the
Internet
,
listen
to
the
radio
and
read
magazines
and
newspapers
,
so
it
will
be
the
best
way
to
make
them
do
sports
.

The
difference
in
earnings
has
dropped
from
almost
40
percent
in
1980
to
30
percent
in
1985
.

It
is
obvious
that
some
faculties
are
more
attractive
to
male
part
of
mankind
,
and
some
of
subjects
to
female
part
.

Suming
up
,
the
tables
provides
full
infromation
in
percentage
of
users
diffrent
social
networks
in
the
USA
,
which
of
the
networks
is
more
popular
and
among
what
age
group
.

All
people
not
only
creative
artists
,
can
say
their
own
opinion
.

In
contrast
,
the
same
tendency
was
shown
in
the
amount
of
black
imprisoned
population
in
the
UK
and
the
USA
that
year
.

People
say
that
violent
video
games
,
for
example
,
can
severely
harm
young
inquisitive
minds
if
we
are
talking
about
children
while
constant
looking
at
the
screens
of
TV
sets
of
computers
without
any
doubt
will
damage
your
ability
to
see
things
properly
.

They
also
outline
if
the
employers
offer
additional
support
to
their
employees
.

In
addition
to
that
,
Yemen
has
n't
enough
up
-
to
-
date
drugs
,
so
people
do
n't
live
for
a
long
time
.

You
can
not
feel
pleased
visiting
such
place
.

It
stayed
stable
there
and
it
is
12,5
during
both
time
periods
.

The
yougest
students
mostly
attended
the
science
courses
where
their
percentage
made
up
55
%
.

Manufactured
goods
are
the
second
most
common
goods
,
they
are
ten
per
cent
less
than
metals
.

Nowadays
there
are
a
lot
of
discussions
about
the
problems
wit
student
's
behaviour
in
schools
.

The
provided
bar
chart
depicts
the
percentage
of
unemployed
people
during
a
two
-
year
period
from
2014
in
five
regions
.

University
education
is
the
mos
individual
issue
,
and
students
are
students
regardless
of
their
gender
.

And
all
people
should
understand
that
only
people
can
solve
the
people
's
problems
.

As
a
second
step
,
parents
should
protect
kids
from
bad
information
in
the
internet
by
installing
special
programs
on
the
laptops
.

Therefore
,
the
film
director
reaches
his
or
her
goal
of
having
striking
audience
.

On
the
second
chart
we
can
observe
the
reasons
to
use
Facebook
of
men
and
women
(
according
their
own
opinions
)
.

To
sum
up
,
i
would
like
to
say
that
if
i
have
a
chance
to
choose
what
decision
to
make
in
this
situation
,
i
will
choose
a
safe
place
instead
of
just
work
of
art
.

To
contemoratly
.

In
conclusion
I
would
like
to
stress
that
happiness
is
something
what
is
understood
differently
by
people
from
different
cultures
.

However
,
all
countries
,
exept
Germany
is
having
a
large
downshift
to
the
year
of
1995
.

In
conclusion
,
I
accept
one
phrase
as
the
main
rule
while
creating
something
:
\"
Think
about
others
.
\"

Comparing
years
1985
and
2005
,
it
could
be
seen
that
the
percentage
of
overweigh
chindren
has
significantly
risen
-
in
2005
there
were
10
percent
more
than
in
the
year
1985
overweigh
girls
and
14
percent
more
boys
,
who
suffered
from
the
big
weigh
.

In
comparison
of
thirst
opinion
,
the
second
was
more
power
,
because
a
person
,
who
wo
nt
work
with
brains
,
who
will
have
reasons
for
improving
the
life
.

Cement
boxes
with

,
enticing
wrappings
.

The
highest
column
on
the
left
side
is
Africa
and
the
smallest
is
South
Asia
.

This
temperature
in
normal
for
all
mounths
of
the
year
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

The
results
show
,
that
the
most
important
field
of
economic
were
selling
of
pop
-
corn
and
Coca
-
Cola
.

What
is
more
,
users
give
their
preference
to
social
networks
where
a
possibility
to
communicate
through
messages
is
offered
.

It
is
argued
that
universities
should
control
this
situation
.

In
conclusion
,
having
considered
this
subject
and
both
advantages
and
disadvantages
,
I
believe
that
the
benefits
of
such
a
system
will
outweigh
the
backwards
as
it
is
a
perfect
social
support
program
.

Both
views
will
be
discussed
in
this
essay
.

To
begin
with
,
very
few
people
will
use
new
sports
classes
or
something
else
.

However
,
still
there
are
serious
problems
with
student
behaviour
.

First
of
all
,
nowadays
cheating
during
the
competition
have
became
such
a
wide
-
spread
appearance
that
only
strict
measures
can
prevent
it
from
further
expansion
.

All
things
considered
,
it
can
be
said
that
the
problem
of
gender
equality
is
still
as
important
as
ever
.

Also
,
art
should
not
be
the
propogand
for
terrorism
or
extrimism
,
because
it
could
have
bad
effect
on
the
society
and
cause
a
lot
of
difficulties
and
problems
.

What
is
more
,
We
get
most
of
the
information
through
the
visual
source
of
perception
,
i.e.
from
our
eyes
.

Overall
,
on
both
charts
it
is
seen
that
the
vast
majority
of
visitors
borrowed
or
returned
books
.

As
a
consequence
,
national
producers
will
try
to
do
their
best
to
sell
their
food
and
attract
new
customers
.

The
most
popular
ideas
have
always
been
causing
very
exciting
discussionsand
debates
.

This
is
very
good
for
countries
economics
.

It
is
clear
,
that
manufactured
goods
remain
stable
and
change
only
for
about
3
%
.

In
conclusion
,
I
can
say
that
then
we
produce
food
not
only
for
our
local
people
,
we
help
to
our
own
country
become
more
economically
stable
and
our
people
to
be
more
intelligent
and
healthy
.

To
prove
this
it
is
enough
to
remember
about
space
race
between
USA
and
USSR
during
The
Cold
War
in
the
20th
century
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
system
of
guaranteed
basic
income
has
a
majority
of
advantages
for
people
's
level
of
life
but
still
it
does
n't
outweigh
the
disadvantages
it
has
because
of
risks
.

Sometimes
people
are
embarassed
when
they
meet
people
in
the
same
clothes
or
trainers
.

The
pie
charts
present
data
on
the
trasporting
of
different
goods
in
Eastern
Europe
in
2008
using
different
types
of
vehicles
.

Overall
,
there
are
two
possible
way
of
transportation
,
by
rail
and
by
road
,
and
six
different
types
of
goods
,
such
as
manufactured
good
,
food
products
,
metals
.

I
myself
have
met
those
kinds
of
people
,
who
rebel
their
families
no
matter
what
,
who
do
not
lose
hope
ever
,
who
would
do
everything
and
do
everything
to
achieve
their
goals
in
life
no
matter
what
family
they
come
from
.

Film
-
makers
and
lingers
think
,
that
the
government
schould
control
the
internet
and
protect
property
rights
of
people
,
who
create
films
and
music
.

To
reduce
this
negative
influence
some
measures
need
to
be
taken
,
the
rest
of
them
may
be
provided
by
implementing
the
modern
technologies
.

For
example
,
many
people
visit
France
not
only
to
visit
Eifel
tower
but
to
taste
frog
legs
or
green
cheese
.

As
a
result
,
he
so
strong
and
never
ill
now
.

On
the
graphs
we
can
see
the
climate
in
very
diffirent
cities
:
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

To
sum
up
,
there
is
no
surprise
that
young
people
spent
more
tome
doing
sport
and
exercise
in
2012
than
old
people
.

In
the
first
chart
it
can
be
seen
that
the
quantity
of
people
using
the
desktop
version
of
Facebook
did
not
significanlty
change
and
only
dropped
a
little
-
from
145
millions
of
users
to
about
130
millions
.

On
the
one
hand
,
if
a
\"
Guaranteed
basic
income
\"
system
is
organised
,
it
will
have
certain
advantages
.

Firstly
it
could
be
considered
that
students
from
the
age
group
of
under
26
mainly
drcide
to
study
in
order
to
build
a
successful
career
.

In
conclusion
the
transportation
of
goods
in
Eastern
Europe
in
2008
was
very
good
.

Generally
speaking
,
the
largest
proportion
of
Internet
users
was
among
urban
and
suburban
households
.

In
1979
the
difference
was
comparedly
small
-
14
millions
versus
10
millions
,
but
over
the
20
years
the
difference
became
drastical
.

In
some
countries
such
an
opportunity
is
highly
welcomed
,
many
advantages
are
thought
to
be
found
,
from
some
people
's
point
of
view
.

It
has
remained
on
this
level
from
2014
.

Some
people
give
other
alternative
ways
of
reducing
crime
.

So
,
we
can
make
a
comparison
between
fifty
years
.

And
when
somobody
creates
anything
he
has
the
right
to
sell
it
to
other
people
.

As
a
conclusion
of
this
manufactures
work
can
be
air
and
water
pollution
.

Yes
,
of
course
they
are
missing
their
money
,
but
they
are
get
fame
and
respect
from
million
people
which
ca
n't
spend
20
-
30
$
on
film
or
50
-
60
$
for
game
.

For
example
,
Hermitage
in
Saint
Petersburg
.

The
problem
of
public
health
is
an
actual
problem
,
that
is
discussed
in
every
country
.

However
with
the
discs
it
is
obvious
that
we
must
to
pay
for
it
,
because
that
is
touchable
product
with
spended
money
on
them
.

Finally
they
say
that
prison
can
teach
people
how
to
become
healthy
part
of
the
society
,
so
schools
and
education
in
prisons
can
help
people
to
socialise
after
leaving
the
prison
.

While
on
the
other
hand
,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
factors
which
can
be
considered
much
more
influential
.

Moreover
to
say
,
having
government
restrictions
for
art
means
that
there
is
a
rule
of
autocracy
,
which
brings
all
the
culture
under
government
propaganda
and
denies
people
's
right
of
getting
a
full
variety
of
information
and
makes
people
blind
.

Taking
everything
into
account
,
the
problem
of
unequality
between
male
and
female
students
is
far
from
solving
yet
:
I
agree
with
the
statement
that
attendance
to
the
every
subject
should
be
equal
among
boys
and
girls
,
but
it
should
be
left
to
every
person
to
choose
whether
to
attend
the
subject
or
not
.

Some
people
think
that
characteristics
given
to
us
when
we
are
just
in
mother
's
bully
influence
out
lifes
.

Facebook
can
be
not
only
a
way
to
entertain
yourself
but
also
a
platform
to
make
it
easier
to
help
others
.

For
example
,
if
you
can
not
to
get
an
original
game
,
you
can
download
a
pirate
copy
and
play
computer
game
without
any
problems
.

Secondly
,
for
many
countries
it
's
impossible
to
survive
in
our
modern
world
,
because
they
have
n't
got
important
and
necessary
resources
,
for
example
oil
,
gas
and
even
water
.

We
should
know
more
about
time
management
and
restrict
time
we
're
spending
with
every
type
of
modern
gadget
.

Secondly
,
if
you
are
sitting
for
a
long
time
you
should
stand
up
and
do
a
little
workout
from
time
to
time
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
I
support
the
second
point
of
view
and
my
reason
is
the
same
-
such
a
long
pause
as
a
gap
year
can
interfere
young
people
from
study
in
normal
way
.

A
rest
or
a
work
can
disturb
or
can
help
,
it
depends
on
us
.

Thirdly
,
the
better
way
to
minimaze
the
radiance
level
in
one
's
apartment
is
to
decrease
the
number
of
gadjetc
in
house
.

In
the
modern
world
there
is
a
concerning
problem
regarding
to
the
public
health
that
is
needed
to
be
improved
.

The
The
temperature
temperature
changes
changes
from
from
-
-
40
40
up
up
to
to
+20
+20
degrees
degrees
.
.

It
is
a
common
opinion
that
architects
do
not
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
appearance
of
their
buildings
as
it
is
more
important
that
their
works
can
serve
their
purpose
.

But
not
everybody
think
,
that
it
's
always
good
.

On
the
one
hand
a
person
must
develop
him
or
her
natural
talents
and
government
must
gradually
support
him
.

There
could
be
serious
reason
that
the
producers
and
musicians
losing
there
money
.

The
first
and
the
main
point
to
opposite
the
preview
statement
is
that
biologically
for
different
sex
consuitable
different
kinds
of
work
.

However
,
I
try
to
show
which
factors
help
to
understand
or
define
own
formula
of
happiness
and
achieve
it
.

Instagram
is
popular
between
young
people
:
more
than
50
%
of
18
-
29
age
group
use
it
.

First
of
all
,
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
big
companies
with
multinational
brands
make
their
goods
really
expensive
,
the
prices
rocket
but
the
quality
stays
at
the
same
level
while
small
componies
are
able
to
sell
the
things
of
good
quality
and
the
prices
are
not
so
high
.

It
remained
stable
in
2015
.

I
do
n't
think
anything
has
a
more
profound
effect
on
the
personal
development
than
the
family
.

Skilled
vocational
diploma
had
10
%
of
Australian
females
.

Crime
is
an
issue
of
increasing
concern
in
the
modern
world
.

But
many
atheletes
use
it
even
at
the
period
of
disqualification
and
life
does
not
teach
them
.

The
leader
of
rail
transportation
were
metals
,
which
consist
35
%
.

And
,
I
think
,
the
most
important
one
is
not
to
argue
in
order
to
warn
a
student
that
he
or
she
is
not
right
.

The
issue
concerning
the
use
of
drugs
which
are
prohibited
among
the
sportsmen
elicits
a
lot
of
controversy
today
.

The
hightest
percetage
in
earings
between
men
and
women
in
1980
existes
in
Japan
and
USA
-
it
is
about
40
percent
.

So
that
it
does
n't
matter
is
a
person
male
or
female
,
he
or
she
has
an
ability
to
study
what
he
or
she
prefers
.

In
the
end
of
the
graph
we
can
see
,
that
in
2040
Japan
had
the
highest
Score
and
USA
was
on
the
last
place
.

The
share
of
the
oldest
group
9
times
smaller
than
the
propotion
of
the
18
-
29
year
old
group
and
equals
only
6
%
.

The
graph
illustrate
much
more
electricity
is
needed
in
winter
than
in
summer
.

In
my
viewpoint
,
those
who
think
that
we
should
bann
athlets
using
drugs
for
the
unlimited
period
have
several
reasons
for
it
.

What
is
more
,
they
tend
to
build
stronger
personal
relationships
and
pay
more
attention
to
those
closest
to
them
.

For
instance
,
the
current
situation
with
refugees
in
Europe
may
show
how
negatively
good
attempts
to
help
people
from
other
countries
can
affect
citizens
.

For
example
,
when
you
want
to
improve
your
imuno
you
should
just
sport
more
time
every
day
.

If
to
do
this
all
together
,
people
health
will
be
increased
after
some
period
of
time
.

The
graph
illustrates
the
proportion
of
minutes
(
billions
)
of
calls
by
telephone
in
the
UK
from
1995
to
2002
.

This
problem
should
be
taken
under
discussion
othertwise
the
number
of
crimes
would
be
increasing
.

Take
a
student
who
lacks
money
for
his
education
and
living
.

Instagram
appears
to
be
popular
among
the
youngest
age
group
with
the
highest
percentage
of
53
percent
of
users
,
but
this
number
is
close
to
the
lowest
Facebook
result
of
56
percent
which
shows
the
oldest
age
group
.

And
,
at
last
,
both
counties
start
in
increase
it
's
levl
of
population
proportion
a
in
2040
reach
it
's
maimum
-
Sweden
-
25
%
a
US
-
23
%
.

However
,
we
do
not
see
this
result
in
our
life
.

As
for
minimum
,
there
are
some
difference
between
two
graphs
in
Brazil
then
in
Russia
,
8
degrees
and
5
degrees
,
for
Rio
de
Janeiro
and
Yakutsk
,
respectively
.

Bad
companies
teach
them
how
to
do
bad
things
,
such
as
stealing
,
dreanking
and
etc
.

That
is
Why
it
is
important
to
know
and
remember
about
side
-
effects
of
modern
devices
and
tools
because
they
have
bad
impact
on
humanity
health
.

Overall
,
Yakutsk
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
have
significantly
different
temperatures
within
one
year
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
,
that
politics
should
allow
to
creative
artists
to
do
what
they
want
to
do
and
make
an
art
in
the
way
they
want
to
see
it
.

There
also
can
be
some
technical
mistakes
during
the
blood
analysis
performed
.

The
graph
presents
data
showing
using
electricity
in
England
during
winters
and
summers
.

Original
line
we
can
see
in
Japan
.

It
will
help
young
people
not
to
face
this
type
of
entertainment
.

However
,
some
people
are
sure
that
technology
can
influence
badly
on
people
's
health
and
cause
some
illnesses
.

So
,
free
content
may
be
a
part
of
business
.

However
,
others
are
sure
that
the
strategy
of
developing
sport
is
not
so
effiecently
as
we
imagine
.

Sometimes
buch
activity
leads
sertain
in
a
ividuals
to
think
that
even
educational
programs
of
every
subject
should
provide
the
same
number
of
students
of
both
sexes
.

We
found
strong
religious
sense
in
the
building
of
St.
Peter
Squares
;
and
We
found
beautiful
scientific
patterns
in
the
Golden
Gate
Bridge
.

Provided
that
every
participant
sweared
to
compete
honestly
,
the
everlasting
ban
does
not
seem
to
be
an
unfair
punishment
.

All
in
all
,
in
my
point
of
view
taking
a
gap
year
is
a
great
opportunity
to
develop
yourself
as
a
person
and
to
prepare
some
kind
of
\"
base
\"
for
your
future
career
.

From
June
there
was
wild
drop
of
temperatur
in
Rissia
,
however
in
Brazil
was
gradul
rose
.

They
offer
different
ways
to
make
people
closer
to
physical
activities
,
for
example
to
increase
the
number
of
sports
classes
in
schools
and
universities
,
to
make
some
gyms
free
and
to
create
special
sports
objects
for
children
and
adults
.

They
often
ca
n't
do
anything
else
except
their
profession
,
so
leaving
a
career
forever
might
mean
an
end
to
all
their
perspectives
.

Sport
should
be
in
complex
with
overimproving
things
.

It
can
be
seen
that
there
are
used
two
ways
:
railways
and
roads
.

For
other
reason
,
It
is
easier
to
write
your
own
music
or
do
film
,
then
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
for
every
film
,
or
for
musical
album
.

Furthermore
,
if
the
youth
are
not
gradanated
properly
,
the
government
will
gwt
a
bad
generation
which
will
not
be
able
to
develop
the
country
.

I
I
think
think
the
the
authorities
authorities
should
should
take
take
into
into
account
account
that
that
their
their

In
2
graphik
,
pie
charts
,
merals
and
non
-
metallic
minerals
have
a
summarise
information
.

Hence
,
there
are
some
examples
:
Ekaterina
Yourieva
competed
in
biathol
broke
rules
twice
.

The
second
chart
provides
information
on
the
main
reasons
men
and
women
give
when
asked
why
they
use
Facebook
.

All
of
these
things
we
get
from
born
,
or
,
at
least
,
we
can
tend
to
some
sphere
of
activity
.

A
lot
of
sports
fans
feel
so
involved
with
the
game
that
if
their
favorite
team
gets
knocked
out
,
it
aggravates
them
so
much
that
they
cause
disturbance
to
other
people
.

These
two
graphs
show
the
average
temperatures
in
Yakutsk
(
Russia
)
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
(
Brazil
)
.

To
begin
with
,
it
does
not
seen
unreasonable
that
without
appreciating
the
nature
children
can
not
also
understand
and
study
the
things
that
are
made
by
human
beings
.

The
pie
charts
represents
the
information
about
world
-
market
between
European
countries
and
kinds
of
transporting
goods
.

In
China
,
for
2018
there
will
be
a
fall
in
print
market
and
the
smallest
level
of
eBook
market
than
in
other
countries
(
in
204
0,5
billion
dollars
and
in
2014
1
billion
dollars
)
In
UK
,
in
2018
there
will
be
a
increase
in
printed
book
market
and
a
drop
in
eBook
market
by
2018
.

To
sum
up
,
I
totally
disagree
with
the
stated
opinion
because
,
firstly
,
beautiful
buildings
may
cause
people
to
buy
the
apartment
or
work
in
there
,
and
,
moreover
,
architects
will
like
producing
it
so
they
will
not
make
any
terrible
mistake
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
current
and
future
situation
on
print
and
eBook
market
covering
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
UK
in
2014
and
2018
.

The
chart
accumulates
that
the
biggest
unemployment
rate
is
in
the
North
Africa
-
12,5
%
and
the
lowest
is
in
the
South
Asia
-
3,9
%
.

The
leading
country
on
this
list
is
Japan
.

Only
the
complete
ban
from
the
future
professional
competition
will
solve
the
problem
,
as
it
will
encourage
fear
of
using
drugs
among
the
sportsmen
.

We
are
given
two
pie
charts
that
represent
information
about
the
main
purposes
of
using
public
libraries
in
the
UK
in
1990
and
2000
.

So
why
people
who
made
this
must
be
stopped
?

Where
the
length
of
route
was
28
kilometres
and
capacity
50
.

The
chart
illustrates
that
the
small
percentage
of
visiters
used
the
public
libraries
to
study
(
10
%
)
in
1999
and
only
2
%
in
2000
.

To
avoid
feeling
pathetic
lots
of
people
tend
to
buy
high
-
fashion
items
and
luxurious
cars
.

The
percentage
there
starts
at
40
,
peaks
around
1985
reaching
about
41
-
42
%
and
decreases
by
the
end
of
the
period
stopping
at
30
.

It
has
a
lot
of
benefits
.

However
,
there
is
another
picture
with
people
who
have
undergraduate
diploma
.

Yemen
is
a
young
-
populated
country
,
about
50
%
of
people
are
children
.

Nowadays
males
and
females
are
supposed
to
have
equal
possibilities
,
but
it
is
often
noticed
that
there
are
more
male
students
studying
some
subjects
,
while
other
faculties
have
more
females
.

In
1995
the
results
were
on
the
same
level
with
16
%
.

But
others
do
not
agreed
.

Overall
,
Japan
has
the
unique
tendency
of
growth
apart
from
Sweden
and
the
USA
.

Temperature
in
Yakutsk
rises
greatly
from
-
40
°
C
in
December
and
January
to
its
maximum
of
25
degrees
in
July
.

Fisrtly
,
from
the
early
childhood
family
members
teach
their
children
their
traditions
,
norms
of
behaviour
,
ways
of
the
social
interaction
and
instill
their
habits
and
several
basic
values
.

In
our
modern
day
and
age
the
problem
of
helping
is
essential
.

First
of
all
,
we
will
pay
attention
to
the
book
market
in
USA
.

Some
people
say
that
new
inventions
could
lead
to
illnesses
.

To
sum
up
,
activity
of
pirates
is
illegal
and
cause
damage
to
authors
.

Than
it
diminished
to
5,8
per
cent
.

As
for
the
UK
,
wich
is
the
country
with
the
lowest
book
market
income
,
it
is
also
the
only
country
where
the
data
is
quite
on
the
same
level
in
both
print
and
eBooks
categories
.

Producers
,
musicians
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
make
a
product
.

In
conclusion
I
want
to
say
,
that
we
need
to
do
sport
,
because
it
helps
us
to
live
more
and
we
need
have
healthy
children
who
will
also
do
different
activities
,
Try
to
find
yourself
in
different
sport
and
be
the
best
.

Firstly
,
the
medicine
itself
as
well
as
it
's
development
,
curing
uncurable
by
now
ilnesses
,
profilactic
and
the
attendence
of
complex
health
researches
is
not
less
important
.

My
opinion
aligns
somewhere
in
the
middle
,
however
I
tend
to
lean
towards
the
importance
of
aesthetics
.

However
,
the
meanings
of
France
and
Sweden
has
extremely
fallen
.

When
I
was
a
child
I
was
behaving
like
my
uncle
.

Generally
speaking
,
the
proportion
of
women
,
who
held
undergraduate
diploma
and
bachelor
's
degree
,
was
bigger
than
the
males
one
,
whereas
the
percentage
of
men
qualificated
with
skilled
vocational
diploma
,
postgraduate
diploma
and
master
's
degree
was
greater
than
the
females
one
.

When
countries
are
oriented
only
on
their
own
population
,
they
break
these
relations
and
lose
money
.

As
for
the
solution
,
most
of
the
responsibility
lays
down
of
parents
and
teachers
of
the
teenagers
.
most
of
the
times
it
is
them
who
do
not
give
enough
attention
to
their
children
and
students
and
ignore
foretelling
hints
to
the
bad
side
of
their
younger
citizens
to
appear
.

The
smallest
gap
between
genders
numbers
was
10
%
for
bachelor
's
degree
,
when
women
overweighe
men
.

Personally
,
I
think
that
there
can
be
no
excuse
for
cheating
in
the
professional
sports
competition
,
especially
if
it
is
very
important
,
for
example
,
world
championship
,
or
olympic
games
,
that
is
why
i
think
that
people
who
use
illegal
drugs
should
be
banned
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.

In
addition
,
many
areas
of
even
biggest
countries
have
bumped
into
luck
of
facilities
for
sport
nowadays
,
so
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
pure
countries
have
even
more
drastical
problems
in
this
field
.

To
begin
with
,
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
temperatures
remain
roughly
stable
during
the
whole
period
.

The
second
chart
shows
that
the
US
general
population
is
composed
by
64
percent
white
and
36
percent
non
-
white
citizens
.

The
main
trend
thar
by
train
transported
a
way
over
metals
then
by
road
.

At
first
,
it
's
necessary
to
do
that
outdoors
are
becames
more
exciting
and
intersting
then
the
surfing
in
the
Internet
…
To
summarize
…

High
necessity
to
build
the
career
makes
people
spend
less
time
on
their
families
.

It
is
followed
by
a
slump
to
17,000
units
in
the
evening
.

But
if
you
need
to
have
a
real
result
,
you
have
to
work
at
your
baby
's
personality
at
its
first
steps
.

They
did
not
tell
me
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
,
I
understood
it
making
my
own
choices
,
but
also
thinking
about
what
would
my
mother
or
father
do
.

On
top
of
it
,
according
to
the
plan
,
there
should
have
been
a
huge
statue
of
Lenin
.

In
other
cases
,
a
way
of
compromising
should
be
founded
.

Worldwide
rate
of
unemployment
is
queit
rate
.

Moving
forward
,
buildings
can
represent
the
creative
idea
of
autors
.

Finally
,
i
'd
like
to
say
that
the
advantages
of
this
development
outweigh
the
disadvantages
.

To
conclude
,
we
have
the
situation
when
the
illegal
copying
and
sharing
of
the
media
content
is
wildspread
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
an
opposite
opinion
saying
that
the
increasing
number
of
sport
facilities
is
not
the
best
way
to
solve
such
problem
.

My
brothe
was
banned
from
competion
for
a
limited
period
-
one
year
.

First
of
all
,
all
people
are
individual
.

The
numbers
are
presented
in
percent
.

I
do
believe
,
that
sport
can
solve
this
problem
,
because
when
you
do
this
you
are
focused
only
on
this
deal
and
can
relax
and
get
rid
of
bad
things
from
your
mind
.

The
second
pie
chart
also
shows
that
slightly
more
than
a
half
of
people
(
55
%
)
visit
libraries
for
that
purpose
.

In
1940
the
old
population
in
Sweden
was
about
7
%
.

It
can
be
seen
that
using
Facebook
on
phone
become
more
popular
,
while
desktop
version
is
losing
its
users
.

There
is
another
positive
point
for
the
unguiltiveness
of
pirates
and
who
use
their
files
is
that
some
newest
films
and
songs
are
decreased
in
level
of
intellectual
idea
.

There
is
the
same
problem
with
video
games
.

Moreover
,
it
is
easy
to
control
quality
in
big
company
,
so
you
don
need
to
create
many
different
comissions
.

Moreover
,
by
puting
this
kid
in
a
jail
and
not
giving
him
help
there
and
thereafter
to
socialise
and
find
a
normal
job
and
people
to
interact
with
,
will
most
likely
make
him
a
life
-
long
prisoner
.

For
instance
,
if
the
country
is
finantially
supported
by
the
other
governments
,
it
gains
an
opportunity
to
succeed
in
creation
and
advertising
of
the
local
produce
and
take
up
the
sector
of
the
world
trade
that
was
previously
occupied
by
another
state
.

That
's
why
I
disagree
with
this
statement
.

France
had
the
amount
in
less
than
50
and
Sweeden
had
less
than
30
%
in
2015
.

On
the
contrary
,
the
print
market
of
these
countries
will
decrease
.

So
,
probably
this
situation
should
not
be
radically
solved
.

The
given
graph
depicts
the
changes
in
the
percentages
of
the
people
aged
65
and
over
in
the
time
period
between
1940
and
2040
in
three
countries
.

Firstly
,
there
are
special
film
industries
in
the
UK
and
in
the
USA
,
especially
in
the
USA
,
which
have
much
more
money
and
opportunities
than
these
industries
in
other
countries
.

That
is
why
they
are
less
sportive
and
sometimes
even
have
some
serious
problems
with
their
back
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
an
other
group
of
social
media
.

To
summ
up
this
information
,
I
can
say
that
my
position
is
the
following
:
we
must
use
the
childhood
to
teach
our
children
foreign
languages
because
it
is
the
best
time
for
it
.

But
50
years
later
situation
in
Yemen
is
predicted
to
change
percent
of
adults
will
increase
,
while
the
number
of
children
will
decrease
.

11
percent
for
road
transortation
and
16
percent
for
transportation
by
road
.

The
graph
depicts
the
information
about
people
aged
65
and
over
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
The
USA
between
1940
and
2040
.

By
observing
this
table
,
it
is
obvious
that
services
sector
achived
the
highest
numbers
,
that
is
why
it
could
be
summed
up
that
industry
was
the
least
popular
employment
sector
among
female
and
male
workers
.

To
conclude
,
there
is
a
tendency
of
growing
in
number
of
people
,
who
are
65
and
older
.

The
question
about
influence
on
children
is
always
triggered
heated
debates
.

Nevertheless
,
to
percieve
yourself
as
a
happy
person
,
you
should
have
a
goal
you
strongly
want
to
succeed
,
because
without
it
it
not
possible
to
continue
real
life
.

To
my
mind
,
a
building
is
like
a
human
-
what
is
inside
is
important
without
any
doubt
,
but
what
is
outsides
matters
too
.

If
universities
had
accepted
equal
quantity
of
students
in
16
-
19
centuries
despite
of
their
mental
activity
,
modern
society
would
never
have
industrial
machines
,
planes
and
cues
just
because
young
scientist
,
who
had
innovating
ideas
,
were
not
accepted
university
.

Nevertheless
,
level
of
Bachelor
's
degree
around
of
men
was
just
more
than
50
per
cent
.

I
allmastly
agree
thet
creative
artists
should
have
freedom
for
their
activity
.

What
's
for
factors
which
are
important
to
achieve
happiness
,
I
can
name
your
ability
to
feel
yourself
and
be
awared
of
your
true
inner
needs
.

The
highest
percentage
in
2000
is
in
the
age
group
from
15
to
59
.

In
conclusion
I
want
to
say
that
there
ar
some
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
bouth
sistem
of
entring
in
the
university
.

All
in
all
we
can
see
that
people
use
Facebook
for
communicatoin
.

Of
course
,
as
humanity
develops
,
develops
sport
industry
as
well
.

The
chart
illustate
the
unemployment
rate
in
different
regions
in
2014
and
2015
.

The
UK
had
23
%
in
1995
and
Usa
had
20
%
in
1995
.

It
's
save
the
economic
of
country
and
create
the
work
places
for
people
.

Universities
should
give
places
to
people
who
deserved
them
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
he
or
she
.

The
group
which
consist
of
people
from
15
to
59
is
the
largest
there
.

I
think
that
this
view
is
correct
and
will
disuss
the
reasons
why
in
this
essay
.

It
is
clear
from
the
visual
that
in
1985
and
1990
there
were
more
overweight
girls
:
12
per
cent
and
14
per
cent
accordingly
.

Women
was
prefered
undergraduate
diploma
.

It
is
clear
,
that
modern
technologies
,
such
as
mobile
phones
,
laptops
and
others
,
have
significant
influence
on
health
.

Minimum
temperatures
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
go
down
from
near
25
degrees
in
February
to
the
lowest
18
degrees
above
0
in
July
.

I
believe
,
that
if
you
young
and
healf
,
you
can
do
many
things
,
and
get
a
good
marks
.

The
pie
charts
below
depict
information
about
goods
'
transportation
between
Eastern
European
countries
in
2008
.

Moreover
,
because
of
this
first
fact
,
in
my
view
,
it
will
be
impossible
to
teach
equally
groups
of
two
genders
.

This
information
is
given
for
four
countries
:
USA
,
China
,
Germany
and
UK
.

Second
and
may
be
even
more
important
criminals
will
go
for
a
higher
crimes
to
avoid
prison
.

As
for
me
,
this
fact
will
affect
them
if
parents
or
even
government
donot
restrict
amoral
ways
of
expression
of
ideas
.

I
believe
there
is
a
little
doubt
about
the
idea
of
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
in
every
subject
.

Government
should
define
the
limits
of
our
freedom
to
expression
,
and
I
think
,
that
this
is
the
main
goal
of
government
.

ACCORDING
TO
THE
DATA
,
IF
MENTAL
DESEASES
WERE
FOUND
ON
THE
FIRST
STAGES
IN
CHILDHOOD
,
WE
WOULD
PREVENT
MUCH
MORE
CRIMES
IN
AGE
OF
16
-
21
.

In
some
cases
,
government
have
to
support
creative
people
to
open
and
show
their
own
talants
and
ideas
and
give
him
right
way
to
do
this
.

The
proportion
of
the
citizens
aged
65
and
over
was
stable
between
1960
and
1987
.

Also
we
are
always
in
a
hurry
and
we
want
to
eat
fast
.

Neverveless
Instagram
is
used
by
53
%
of
the
young
group
.

I
personally
think
that
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
ban
athletes
for
about
two
years
to
give
them
time
to
regroup
and
reflect
on
their
future
career
.

In
addition
,
every
our
need
has
it
's
own
price
.

People
of
different
age
have
different
ineterests
and
needs
that
is
why
the
percentage
can
vary
.

For
instance
,
it
is
health
,
because
if
you
are
unhealthy
the
only
thing
you
think
of
is
how
to
stop
pain
.

However
,
only
in
one
sector
in
countries
female
workers
are
more
than
male
.

They
live
for
art
.

Naturally
,
nobody
will
have
so
time
to
worry
about
how
it
looks
like
.

There
are
heated
debates
on
whether
it
is
a
real
crime
and
what
punishment
should
the
culpable
face
.

Schools
are
one
of
the
places
where
such
behaviour
can
actually
be
improved
.

It
stays
on
a
peace
of
grownd
near
the
city
and
if
something
destroy
it
everyone
will
be
safe
.

Taking
everything
into
consideration
,
there
are
two
points
of
view
on
the
problem
of
the
production
and
import
food
to
other
countries
is
very
controversial
,
especially
for
governments
,
which
have
only
food
production
.

Our
world
is
full
of
the
cities
,
some
of
them
are
works
of
art
,
others
have
good
planning
.

On
the
other
hand
,
people
older
than
26
mostly
choose
sports
and
health
courses
.

In
addition
both
male
and
female
students
study
at
schools
and
colleges
or
universities
under
the
same
conditions
.

The
reason
for
that
can
be
a
lack
of
phones
with
cameras
among
old
people
.

Anyway
,
each
underground
railway
system
is
special
,
just
like
the
city
it
is
located
in
.

What
is
more
,
an
architect
may
make
a
fatal
mistake
when
he
or
she
is
bored
,
and
many
people
will
die
because
of
it
.

Is
it
possible
to
reduce
crime
by
giving
longer
prison
sentences
of
is
it
alternative
ways
?

The
first
chart
provides
data
on
both
-
visitors
from
abroad
and
the
UK
citizents
who
traveled
abroad
,
whilst
the
second
one
shows
inly
a
comparison
of
the
most
visited
countries
by
people
from
UK
in
1999
.

We
should
give
many
reasons
so
people
would
like
to
do
it
.

Personally
I
think
,
that
currently
there
are
lots
of
homeless
children
or
children
who
's
parents
are
not
interested
in
their
children
's
life
.

In
this
case
,
everyone
who
works
at
school
,
should
be
very
attentive
and
notice
the
changes
which
happen
with
some
students
,
trying
to
know
the
reason
of
their
bad
behaviour
or
sometimes
their
aggressive
manner
.

Our
DNA
gives
us
characteristics
of
our
fathers
and
grandfathers
.

In
my
mind
it
is
a
good
thing
.

From
these
two
tables
we
may
see
the
percentage
of
wokers
of
different
genders
in
three
employment
sectors
in
two
countries
:
Indonesia
and
Australia
.

I
think
that
such
changes
are
signs
of
a
healthy
society
and
I
could
n't
be
more
grateful
to
see
them
.

But
in
midle
East
situation
is
much
better
the
rate
of
umemployment
felt
from
11
to
9,6
which
says
us
about
good
government
politic
.

Moreover
,
in
all
three
countries
the
growth
of
proportion
of
population
aged
65
and
over
is
expected
to
be
after
2020
.

As
we
can
see
,
such
regions
,
as
Nothern
Africa
and
South
Asia
have
the
same
unemployment
rate
both
in
2014
and
2015
(
12,5
%
for
N.
Africa
and
3,9
%
for
S.
Asia
)
.

It
is
a
very
controvercial
topic
.

I
strongly
believe
that
increasing
of
number
of
sport
facilities
will
not
solve
problems
with
the
people
's
health
.

As
the
table
shows
,
the
oldest
subway
system
is
situated
in
London
and
the
newest
is
located
in
Los
-
Angeles
.

One
of
these
ways
is
reduce
prodaction
of
unhealthy
or
junk
food
.

On
the
one
hand
,
the
scientific
research
is
better
to
be
paid
and
supported
by
the
government
,
as
the
government
has
more
money
and
power
.

Firstly
,
each
country
has
its
own
government
which
is
supposed
to
take
care
of
the
population
it
leads
.

In
EU
2015
year
unemployement
rate
grow
on
0,4
.

For
example
,
Monaco
has
a
very
small
territory
and
a
big
number
of
people
living
there
.

People
can
choose
different
ways
of
living
,
different
works
,
different
houses
and
different
behaviour
.

Also
people
should
rake
some
medicine
for
improve
their
immunity
.

But
it
can
be
solved
with
the
help
of
parents
and
teachers
,
who
should
provide
a
good
examle
to
children
and
show
them
the
right
way
to
life
.

People
should
remember
,
that
Internet
nor
only
for
our
intertaiment
,
but
for
getting
new
knowledges
about
the
world
around
us
.

The
given
chart
shows
the
information
about
Post
-
school
qualification
in
Australia
in
1999
.

Overall
,
the
bar
chart
demonstrates
that
in
North
Africa
the
unemployment
rate
hit
a
pick
and
in
South
Africa
it
hit
a
low
.

Another
factor
,
is
prosperity
of
country
.

With
all
that
said
it
is
obvious
that
nowadays
difference
in
income
between
men
and
women
becomes
smaller
each
year
nearly
everywhere
.

Alexander
Pluschenko
,
for
example
,
had
injured
himself
during
last
Olympic
games
,
despite
the
fact
that
he
knew
about
his
health
problem
.

However
,
by
the
end
of
the
researched
period
there
was
a
dramatic
rise
for
girls
that
do
exercises
,
while
for
boys
the
growth
was
less
considerable
.

So
,
students
can
eat
,
shout
in
the
classroom
and
do
not
go
to
the
school
.

The
charts
show
what
goods
were
transported
by
rail
and
by
road
in
Eastern
Europe
countries
in
2008
.

Most
people
,
both
male
and
female
,
work
for
the
services
sector
,
where
women
account
for
88
percent
and
men
account
for
65
percent
.

To
say
more
,
there
are
such
individuals
who
just
enjoy
working
.

In
the
first
statistics
the
attendance
of
science
courses
is
illustrated
.

The
smallest
percentage
of
all
goods
is
related
to
non
-
metallic
minerals
on
the
first
picture
(
approximately
4
%
)
and
machinery
(
2
%
)
on
the
second
.

However
I
understand
the
necessity
of
making
money
in
order
to
provide
myself
and
my
family
with
all
of
things
that
can
be
beneficial
for
wellbeing
.

Firstly
,
no
one
wants
to
die
if
this
work
of
art
will
fall
or
breake
.

The
sphere
of
fitness
is
very
popular
nowadays
but
it
is
very
expensive
.

However
,
this
part
should
not
be
made
by
cutting
other
parts
,
which
are
more
crucial
for
society
.

Overall
,
as
the
age
of
people
grows
both
Facebook
and
Instagram
become
less
popular
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
duration
of
such
a
ban
should
be
connected
with
the
motives
of
sportsmen
.

Then
I
am
going
to
express
my
own
opinion
on
the
question
.

In
the
90s
,
a
video
game
called
Doom
was
released
on
the
market
,
which
soon
became
very
popular
.

In
conclussion
I
'd
like
to
say
that
,
sure
sport
is
important
part
in
our
life
,
but
it
is
decide
to
everyone
use
or
not
sport
in
real
life
.

The
most
obvious
example
is
air
and
water
polluted
by
the
chemical
industries
,
oil
companies
and
simply
everyday
use
of
cars
burning
gasoline
and
dumping
the
waste
in
the
air
.

For
male
users
,
the
second
reason
for
using
Facebook
receiving
updates
,
39
percent
of
male
users
answered
like
this
.

In
past
we
had
only
few
main
kinds
of
art
:
music
,
art
,
literature
,
arhitecture
,
theatre
,
and
,
probably
,
the
clothes
.

On
the
other
hand
,
others
opinion
is
that
government
activities
would
have
little
effect
on
health
of
population
.

The
second
number
is
11
and
9,6
%
in
2014
and
2015
years
respectively
in
Middle
East
.

It
accounts
about
25
°
C
.

It
is
clear
from
the
bar
chart
that
the
percentage
of
overweight
children
had
been
increasing
gradually
from
1985
to
2005
when
the
level
of
obesed
children
reached
its
pike
(
25
%
)
.

As
regards
reasons
for
using
Facebook
,
the
main
one
for
women
is
sharing
photos
or
videos
(
54
%
)
and
the
least
important
is
learning
about
ways
to
help
others
(
35
%
)
.

Such
kind
of
people
spents
its
free
time
to
produce
music
or
make
a
film
.

The
budget
of
local
movies
is
really
small
and
they
ca
n't
afford
to
spend
more
on
the
translation
of
the
movie
.

A
lot
of
people
see
illegal
drugs
usage
in
sport
as
a
crime
of
a
major
importance
.

Taking
modern
tendencies
into
account
this
kind
of
university
would
be
seen
democratic
and
most
forward
thinking
.

The
highest
rate
is
in
Africa
-
12,5
.

First
of
all
,
some
artists
may
express
their
ideas
in
amoral
way
.

Thus
,
students
easily
get
bored
and
learning
process
is
not
succesful
.

There
is
no
secret
that
top
sportsmen
not
only
have
training
almost
every
day
to
achieve
highest
positions
in
competitions
but
also
use
different
types
of
drugs
.

When
country
stop
their
import
of
fruits
,
meals
,
and
etc
.
country
decreases
their
vary
in
food
in
the
market
that
may
badly
cover
getting
vytamins
.

At
second
,
international
distribution
of
wealth
may
provide
newcomers
with
anxienty
and
willing
to
bury
with
the
whole
society
in
order
to
eliminate
and
get
closer
to
benefits
.

That
is
important
because
people
tend
to
leave
litter
in
the
places
which
are
already
full
with
it
.

There
are
some
differents
of
demographical
picture
between
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
2050
years
.

Moreover
,
in
both
regions
in
2014
and
2015
the
rates
were
on
the
same
level
.

This
pattern
may
be
noticed
both
for
English
men
and
women
.

Generally
speaking
,
USA
book
market
is
the
most
development
,
with
print
books
market
allocating
10,8
billion
of
US
dollars
in
2014
.

While
some
people
would
say
that
family
makes
the
most
vital
influence
in
children
's
lives
,
others
will
argue
that
external
communications
have
a
greater
impact
.

To
the
contrary
,
the
shortest
route
has
Kyoto
's
railway
-
only
11
kilometres
.

The
figures
changed
in
undergraduate
diplomas
.

Furtemore
,
we
can
see
a
growth
of
unemployment
in
Europe
.

They
believe
that
works
of
art
cost
much
and
there
is
no
opportunity
to
build
as
many
such
buildings
as
it
is
needed
for
all
the
citizens
.

This
means
,
that
there
are
particular
duties
and
functions
which
the
government
must
follow
.

To
my
way
of
thinking
,
the
increasement
of
the
number
of
sport
facilities
will
definitely
improve
public
health
.

The
graph
illustrates
that
during
all
hundred
years
the
trends
of
population
's
growth
were
different
in
all
3
countries
.

For
example
,
famous
musician
Phillipe
Kirkorov
has
once
said
that
he
is
ready
to
spread
his
music
among
people
for
free
as
real
arts
is
more
important
than
\"
real
\"
money
.

Sugested
chart
below
gives
to
us
innformation
about
the
proportion
of
the
population
aged
65
and
ove
between
1940
and
2040
in
USA
,
Japan
and
Sweden
.

I
think
,
everyone
has
own
opinion
about
happiness
and
thus
it
is
very
difficult
to
define
it
.

The
most
important
thing
they
can
do
is
to
pay
more
attention
towards
children
's
development
and
their
moral
education
.

Many
people
find
these
materials
on
the
Internet
and
download
them
by
illegal
ways
.

To
sum
up
,
I
strongly
believe
that
making
illegal
pirate
copies
is
a
bad
thing
.

That
means
at
technical
and
humanitarian
faculties
will
be
equal
persons
of
male
and
female
sex
.

So
two
weeks
before
the
concert
lot
of
people
heard
his
song
.

Secondly
,
they
should
improve
and
develop
sport
system
in
education
of
children
and
teens
.

To
sum
up
,
illigal
coping
of
fillms
and
music
and
films
make
danger
not
only
for
creators
but
for
consumers
too
.

So
,
the
government
should
legalize
this
type
of
copying
and
sharing
musician
and
filmography
products
,
because
it
is
more
available
for
mostly
all
citizens
of
the
country
.

Firstly
,
I
will
discuss
about
two
reasons
of
argument
for
to
being
with

The
idea
of
banning
athletes
using
drugs
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
has
its
right
to
exist
.

Other
point
of
view
is
other
measures
are
required
.

The
parcentage
in
those
countrieas
has
fallen
for
about
10
%
.

For
example
,
almost
all
cildren
are
visualists
,
they
love
bright
shiny
things
,
all
items
that
are
easy
and
plesant
to
look
at
.

That
is
why
illegal
pirate
copies
should
not
be
allowed
because
they
demolish
all
creators
'
profits
.

If
population
will
understand
that
sport
in
necessary
for
their
health
,
and
wiil
start
practise
football
or
fitness
,
the
level
of
public
health
will
soar
.

Also
,
it
is
important
to
mention
that
the
worldwide
unemployment
rate
is
significantly
lower
that
in
the
most
regions
and
it
is
only
5,9
%
.

As
for
the
third
social
media
,
LinkedIn
,
it
is
popular
for
all
the
age
groups
.

Firstly
,
the
consumption
of
electricity
during
winter
days
increase
at
3
o'clock
to
40000
degrees
of
electricity
and
then
reaches
a
bottom
of
30000
units
at
7
hours
.

One
more
reason
to
contradict
mu
position
is
to
say
a
couple
words
about
loyality
.

Government
should
n't
prevent
societ
from
any
kind
of
art
.
I
completely
agree
with
this
point
of
view
.

For
the
university
,
the
prime
concern
should
be
on
student
's
motivation
and
eagerness
to
develop
,
the
gender
does
n't
matter
.

But
there
is
a
significant
drawback
in
this
point
of
view
.

Percent
of
men
who
held
it
is
about
90
and
of
women
is
about
10
.

To
conclude
,
modern
technology
are
the
important
part
of
our
life
and
like
all
things
in
the
worlds
have
bad
effects
.

Overall
,
almost
in
all
four
countries
profit
from
eBook
production
will
slightly
raise
and
from
production
of
print
books
slightly
fall
.

Percent
of
young
men
and
women
differs
significantly
from
the
one
for
aged
people
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
it
is
good
for
artists
to
express
their
creative
ideas
in
many
different
ways
they
like
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
considered
that
these
changes
should
be
obligatary
accepted
.

It
is
noticeable
that
the
mean
feature
of
the
first
graph
is
percentage
of
transported
metals
(
35
%
)
.

There
is
an
opinion
,
that
every
subject
in
the
university
should
be
studied
by
an
equal
amount
of
males
and
females
.

Thirdly
,
as
a
rule
,
sportmen
and
sport
records
are
pride
of
almost
every
country
,
and
it
is
easy
to
predict
people
's
need
to
be
famous
or
be
just
like
their
own
heroes
,
so
,
being
physically
strong
is
vital
in
this
case
.

Parents
teach
their
children
not
to
sleep
near
the
mobile
phones
and
not
to
put
them
in
pockets
near
the
body
.

The
second
advantage
of
large
brands
is
the
convinience
for
customers
.

Cheating
in
sport
takes
form
of
using
illegal
drugs
by
sportsmen
to
increase
their
physical
powers
.

First
of
all
,
it
can
be
seen
that
in
USA
producing
of
print
books
in
2014
rather
were
hire
,
than
in
2018
(
in
2014
it
was
10,5
billion
us
dollars
,
but
in
2018
it
will
be
only
7,5
billion
US
dollars
)
.

They
can
stay
healthy
using
other
methods
,
for
example
-
eating
healthy
food
.

The
pie
charts
below
prodive
us
with
the
information
about
the
ages
of
the
populations
of
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
predictions
for
2050
.

Actually
the
both
charts
are
n't
so
different
ecpet
two
type
of
goodsL
metals
and
food
.

The
truth
is
in
the
middle
.

First
of
all
,
it
is
not
a
secret
that
telephone
mobiles
,
which
we
use
everyday
,
produce
radiowaves
.

On
the
other
hand
,
some
people
are
sure
that
sport
is
not
the
most
appropriate
way
if
you
want
to
make
people
healthier
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
percentage
of
adults
in
the
USA
who
use
different
social
networks
according
to
their
age
.

In
my
opinion
,
sports
facilities
really
can
help
tp
improve
public
health
and
motivate
people
to
do
sports
,
but
there
are
undoubtebly
should
exists
other
facts
-
mainly
,
man
's
wants
to
be
healthy
.

It
is
notably
that
trains
largely
transportated
metals
,
while
cars
and
trucks
more
dealed
with
food
products
.

In
winter
the
number
of
pick
the
top
for
more
than
40000
.

Another
point
for
not
establishing
such
laws
is
related
to
future
professions
of
students
and
their
position
in
social
structure
of
our
society
.

It
is
scientifically
proved
that
with
increasing
working
hours
,
a
person
becomes
less
productive
and
has
a
disbalance
in
his
life
.

Firtst
chart
shows
how
many
people
used
desktops
or
mobiles
compering
March
2012
and
March
2013
.

Moreover
,
wrong
posture
,
while
working
with
computer
for
long
hours
,
could
badly
affect
backspine
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
rights
of
women
should
be
respected
everywhere
,
whether
it
concerns
universities
or
some
other
places
.

In
contrast
,
at
the
second
pie
chart
we
can
see
that
arts
courses
were
the
most
popular
among
this
oldest
category
:
their
figure
was
45
%
,
while
the
proportion
of
18
-
25
and
26
-
40
year
olds
was
approximately
the
same
and
accounted
for
around
30
%
of
the
total
(
600
students
)
.

People
could
easily
become
blind
by
using
a
small
screen
phone
.

The
difference
between
men
and
women
who
got
skilled
vocational
diploma
is
substancial
.

It
reached
a
peak
by
12,5
percent
in
North
Africa
and
reached
the
smallest
percentage
in
South
Asia
by
3,9
percent
.

There
is
a
research
about
how
phones
,
social
networks
,
television
,
radio
and
so
on
can
influence
people
's
sleeping
and
their
dreams
.

Also
some
subjects
are
known
to
be
more
female
.

The
bar
chart
provides
the
information
about
the
proportion
of
people
using
three
social
networks
by
four
age
groups
in
the
USA
.

Food
is
one
of
the
most
important
part
of
trading
and
producing
.

It
will
be
about
25
%
.

Europe
is
extraordinary
region
,
where
the
unemployment
rate
was
increased
from
7,5
per
cents
to
7,9
per
cents
by
2015
and
that
's
the
second
tendency
.

It
was
7,5
in
2014
and
became
7,9
in
2015
.

The
cities
will
be
losing
their
cultural
identities
and
it
will
not
be
so
exiting
to
visit
new
cities
of
countries
because
they
are
all
the
same
.

For
example
,
factory
put
wastes
to
nearly
lake
,
fish
in
lake
eat
wastes
and
became
not
so
good
for
eating
,
but
we
do
n't
know
it
,
and
that
fish
was
killed
and
served
to
our
kitchen
table
,
and
after
that
we
had
stomach
problems
.

Japan
,
USA
and
UK
had
approximately
35
-
40
%
difference
in
income
between
men
and
women
from
the
beginning
,
then
the
percentage
of
difference
in
USA
and
UK
went
down
gradually
and
it
made
up
20
-
25
%
in
1990
.

Facebook
is
the
most
popular
social
network
among
all
groups
.

Therefore
,
the
help
from
the
authorities
of
developed
countries
to
the
people
in
the
deprived
areas
of
our
planet
is
necessary
in
order
to
reach
the
equality
at
some
point
of
our
future
history
.

This
sort
of
restriction
is
promoting
the
humanity
,
wich
is
a
basic
idea
of
any
big
competition
.

Even
if
they
are
shocked
by
the
way
an
artist
expresses
himself
they
can
deal
with
it
.

Male
workers
in
Indonesia
's
industry
consist
only
15
%
and
female
workers
consist
only
8
%
and
it
is
very
small
number
,
comparing
to
the
others
employments
(
agriculture
and
services
)
.

As
family
is
the
first
environment
a
child
is
being
involved
into
,
it
is
obvious
to
suppose
that
it
has
the
greatest
impact
.

On
the
last
place
is
skilled
vocational
diploma
and
the
percentage
of
it
do
not
exceed
10
%
.

The
average
percentage
of
users
there
is
lower
than
in
Facebook
because
this
network
use
mostly
the
younger
generation
-
53
%
.

But
other
people
think
that
our
behaviour
form
only
from
that
characteristic
,
which
we
have
when
we
were
born
.

Traditions
are
so
strong
there
that
women
prefer
to
dedicate
their
lives
to
home
and
family
instead
of
studying
in
the
university
.

Regarding
the
first
opinion
,
there
is
a
strong
arguement
to
support
it
.

The
pie
charts
show
how
the
goods
were
transported
between
eastern
europenian
countries
in
2008
.

Latin
America
,
line
Middle
East
region
,
demonstrated
a
declined
unemployment
rate
That
was
6,8
in
2014
and
lowered
to
5,8
next
year
.

The
unemployment
rate
in
the
UE
increases
in
2015
.

The
first
chart
shows
us
changing
in
numbers
of
users
in
millions
for
desktop
and
mobile
versions
.

But
just
see
on
food
products
.

The
question
of
equality
of
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
cause
a
lot
debates
.

Nowaday
many
universities
all
over
the
world
offer
a
wide
range
of
educational
opportunities
,
which
should
be
used
by
both
male
and
female
students
equaly
.

They
organised
acts
of
civil
desobidience
(
like
riots
)
in
different
countries
of
Europe
and
there
were
cases
with
murder
of
ambassadors
.

Then
,
maximum
temperature
drop
slowly
and
stabilizing
June
to
July
.

In
the
other
hand
,
government
do
n't
need
to
produce
food
only
for
export
because
in
that
case
bisuness
in
that
country
can
slowly
down
.

In
In
conclusion
conclusion
,
,
there
there
are
are
a
a
lot
lot
of
of
factors
factors
,
,
besides
besides
genes
genes
,
,
that
that
are
are
vital
vital
in
in
personality

building
building
.
.

But
people
consumed
these
files
just
download
it
like
any
othe
free
information
in
the
Internet
.

I
think
that
's
very
debatable
and
I
ca
n't
directly
and
cleanly
give
you
answer
on
this
question
.

What
it
leads
to
?

Nevertheless
,
there
is
another
point
of
view
.

I
find
the
existing
ways
of
illegal
content
monitoring
highly
ineffective
.

We
can
notice
that
both
in
both
cases
maximum
and
minimum
lines
lines
ressemble
each
other
.

On
the
other
hand
,
even
the
most
developed
nations
are
still
experiencing
crucial
problems
on
their
own
land
.

The
first
diagram
shows
that
during
winter
people
consume
more
units
of
electrisity
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
government
will
restrict
all
of
artist
's
work
the
artists
ca
n't
work
productively
,
because
they
will
be
under
a
big
pressure
.

The
prediction
tells
us
that
the
situation
will
change
in
2020
and
2040
.

It
is
less
than
every
region
,
except
South
Asia
.

First
of
all
,
big
fines
can
be
very
useful
in
this
situation
because
nobody
would
like
to
lose
their
money
.

The
barchart
represent
information
about
post
-
school
qualifications
in
Australia
in
1999
between
males
and
females
.

It
can
be
seen
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
is
very
high
and
varies
between
23
and
30
Celsius
degrees
.

In
this
essay
I
would
like
to
dwell
upon
the
issue
that
this
tendency
can
lead
to
equality
and
high
lever
of
quality
in
every
part
of
the
world
.

Actually
,
the
opinion
that
pirate
copying
should
be
punished
is
really
widespread
around
the
world
.

What
is
more
,
many
people
which
download
torren
files
and
get
pleasure
from
them
will
buy
not
only
licensed
driver
this
product
but
and
next
product
of
this
firm
.

The
oldest
railway
sustenance
from
thouse
in
the
list
is
the
one
which
in
London
it
was
opened
in

and
it
is
also
the
longest
one
,
about
394
kilometres
of
route
.

The

the
difference

It
's
a
well
-
known
fact
that
all
products
from
industry
like
music
and
film
are
easily
illegal
copied
and
transfered
to
the
different
website
for
free
download
,
thus
,
producers
lose
enourmes
amounts
of
money
.

Also
,
because
of
this
reasone
they
could
lose
motivation
to
create
anything
else
.

The
figures
females
who
have
a
Bachelor
's
degree
was
about
55
%
.

We
are
all
different
.

Othervise
someone
just
do
n't
have
money
for
such
entertainment
,
so
they
use
pirat
copies
.

Last
but
not
least
,
the
most
dangerous
enemy
of
the
world
is
humans
.

However
,
the
unemployment
rate
of
EU
has
grown
slightly
in
2015
,
from
7,5
%
to
7,9
%
.

And
other
things
,
which
have
influence
on
health
,
are
important
too
,
and
we
must
consider
them
,
to
solve
health
problem
.

To
sum
up
,
we
can
stead
that
all
this
charts
show
us
one
same
thing
,
that
group
of
people
from
15
to
59
yeas
in
Italy
and
in
Yemen
in
every
time
of
all
this
period
from
2000
to
2050
will
be
the
biggest
part
of
all
population
.

For
example
,
in
Russia
it
is
really
expensive
always
to
buy
original
versions
of
different
movies
or
songs
.

It
It
is
is
not
not
a
a
secret
secret
that
that
each
each
kind
kind
of
of
sport
sport
or
or
even
even
gym
gym
is
is
really
really
expensive
expensive
now
now
.
.

In
the
contrast
,
about
10
percent
of
women
had
the
vocational
diploma
and
it
was
the
least
percentage
in
this
gender
group
.

If
local
goverments
want
to
make
film
industries
better
and
more
popular
,
they
should
pay
attention
to
people
,
who
work
there
,
to
their
education
and
,
of
coure
,
on
their
salaries
.

I
grew
up
at
the
outskirts
of
the
city
,
so
I
studied
at
school
with
a
lot
of
children
,
who
had
some
problems
in
family
.

Nevertheless
,
there
are
some
people
who
post
their
photos
on
Instagram
from
time
to
time
.

Nowadays
,
it
is
very
hard
and
expensive
to
delete
the
information
from
the
Internet
every
time
it
appears
.

Firstly
,
it
provides
a
bigger
possibility
to
rest
later
,
if
you
earned
so
much
that
you
can
make
yourself
feel
free
in
future
decisions
and
desires
,
it
would
bring
a
happy
time
spent
while
old
.

First
point
of
comparison
is
\"
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

I
agree
that
this
category
of
people
should
be
arested
.

Youth
crimes
have
become
a
very
urgent
problem
in
modern
world
.

The
chart
shows
data
about
the
subway
systems
in
six
cities
.

And
the
governement
should
to
use
any
restrictions
for
this
people
.

But
on
the
other
hand
,
people
are
born
in
different
families
,
by
different
parents
,
which
are
weak
and
with
bad
prospects
of
future
child
's
life
,
but
I
am
concerned
,
that
such
destiny
when
man
should
always
fight
for
his
happiness
,
can
make
outstanding
persons
,
history
knows
many
such
cases
.

In
contrast
,
parents
are
responsible
for
their
son
or
daughter
,
so
they
are
obliged
to
try
their
best
in
raising
a
child
.

From
my
own
personal
experience
I
may
say
that
the
more
active
and
educated
teacher
is
the
better
discipline
is
existed
in
the
classroom
.

And
the
problem
is
that
any
work
with
built
in
creativity
is
pot
under
pressure
when
the
money
comes
in
to
the
game
.

But
on
the
other
hand
,
in
my
opinion
,
trying
not
to
import
at
all
is
not
a
good
desition
.

So
,
what
should
be
done
to
reduce
crime
?

And
of
the
art
,
of
course
.

To
sum
up
,
this
problem
is
really
very
difficult
and
actual
nowadays
.

There
are
two
possible
ways
of
transporting
,
by
road
and
by
rail
,
which
are
demonstrated
on
the
charts
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
in
general
the
unemployment
rate
has
went
down
,
remaining
the
same
only
in
N.
Africa
and
S.
Asia
,
but
worldwide
it
showed
average
level
that
was
5,9
both
years
.

Therefore
,
there
should
be
established
a
working
judicial
system
to
protect
the
ownership
rights
with
decent
punishment
for
not
obeying
the
rules
in
order
to
provide
people
with
their
favourite
music
and
movies
.

You
could
just
pay
attention
to
history
.

Every
country
expects
that
e
-
Books
will
rocket
in
four
years
.

But
I
believe
that
this
is
not
true
as
most
of
the
time
it
only
fosters
animocity
between
countries
.

But
it
is
possible
to
provide
this
feeling
if
not
for
ourselves
but
for
people
who
are
around
us
.

It
covers
the
situation
on
the
market
in
2014
with
a
prediction
for
2018
.

I
have
met
many
professional
sportsmen
from
all
over
the
world
.

I
totally
agree
with
this
station
,
because
it
is
necessary
for
countries
to
have
their
own
food
products
.

But
those
who
has
postgraduate
diploma
divided
with
percentages
70
%
and
30
%
with
men
's
leading
.

Nexts
points
have
almost
the
same
proportion
,
which
are
equal
17,5
%
,
15
%
,
and
15
%
.

To
sum
up
,
it
can
be
said
,
that
the
idea
to
accept
the
similar
quantity
of
man
and
woman
in
every
subject
is
good
,
but
it
is
very
hard
to
make
it
real
.

Let
's
consider
some
of
them
.

Secondly
,
government
,
politicians
,
lawers
,
attorneys
and
other
officials
should
pay
their
attention
into
the
problem
of
illegal
pirate
copies
and
direct
the
governmental
policy
to
this
direction
.

They
are
so
exhausted
after
work
that
they
prefer
a
passive
rest
,
like
watching
TV
or
simply
liying
on
a
sofa
.

Without
freedom
its
development
is
impossible
.

To
sum
everything
up
,
it
should
be
empasized
that
in
spite
of
different
results
,
japan
population
(
after
a
perpertual
grouth
)
increased
dramatically
more
in
contrast
to
other
countries
.

Even
though
they
might
seem
like
a
waste
of
money
,
it
is
always
good
to
be
ahead
of
your
opponents
,
and
space
exploration
programs
may
give
such
an
opportunity
.

The
opposite
point
of
view
says
,
that
such
decition
is
uneffective
,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
much
more
productive
measures
are
required
nowadays
.

The
presented
pair
of
diagrams
display
information
about
international
transportation
of
goods
within
the
Eastern
Europe
,
year
2008
.

The
most
and
the
least
popular
reason
is
still
quite
the
same
.

For
example
,
minimum
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
in
January
was
approximately
twenty
third
,
and
at
the
same
time
and
Yakutsk
it
was
minus
fourthly
.

Number
of
men
is
bigger
than
women
and
equals
70
%
at
postgraduate
diploma
and
60
percent
at
master
's
degree
.

At
the
second
graph
the
information
about
average
temperature
in
brazilian
city
Rio
de
Janeiro
is
provided
.

On
the
one
hand
while
our
society
is
arming
for
democratical
ideals
it
is
strictly
needed
among
the
creative
class
to
fightt
for
freedom
and
human
rights
to
protect
and
express
their
freedom
.

For
example
,
some
enviromental
issues
,
such
as
pollution
.

According
to
the
first
point
of
view
we
need
to
expand
the
variety
of
sports
for
the
society
.

Overall
,
in
2050
the
main
part
of
the
population
in
both
countries
will
be
15
-
59
years
old
people
but
in
Italy
there
will
be
less
children
than
in
Yemen
.

There
are
people
who
are
ready
to
reject
not
only
money
but
all
the
facilities
and
conviniencies
suggested
by
modern
civilization
.

Amount
of
people
in
the
age
of
15
-
59
in
this
country
will
fall
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

There
are
bunch
of
people
,
which
are
fully
dependent
on
technics
and
they
lose
connection
with
society
.

These
numbers
could
be
used
only
like
an
information
.

That
is
why
the
level
of
crime
is
enourmous
in
such
areas
where
there
are
more
people
,
who
have
been
in
a
jail
.

One
of
them
is
an
idea
that
countries
should
produce
the
poducts
that
their
population
eats
.

Persons
who
download
pirate
copies
are
not
muders
.

In
addition
,
I
consider
that
if
I
could
find
good
film
in
high
quality
with
good
translation
and
it
has
no
differ
with
original
that
cost
some
money
,
I
may
download
it
without
doubts
or
regrets
.

I
think
it
is
important
to
connect
with
different
countries
.

Sport
develop
our
bodies
,
power
.

Facebook
is
the
most
popular
social
network
.

Secondly
,
I
have
mentioned
earlier
that
these
restrictions
should
not
be
too
serious
.

The
percent
rises
from
7,5
%
to
7,9
%
in
1
year
.

If
the
government
will
give
full
freedom
to
the
full
creative
individuals
is
whether
this
will
lead
to
the
growth
of
creativity
in
the
country
?

I
strongly
disagree
with
this
point
of
view
.

Overall
,
in
the
graph
we
can
see
that
in
the
first
period
of
surving
the
US
,
France
and
Sweeden
used
fossil
fuels
the
most
,
while
at
the
end
of
the
period
China
,
the
US
and
India
became
the
leaders
in
terms
of
usunig
oil
and
gas
as
an
energy
.

This
was
the
most
serious
changes
for
the
all
time
on
the
chart
.

A
person
who
is
able
to
make
true
friends
and
who
knows
that
he
or
she
is
surrounded
by
love
and
care
is
less
likely
to
commit
a
crime
.

Worldwide
,
the
percentage
was
5,9
%
in
2014
as
well
as
in
2015
.

At
the
same
time
,
teachers
at
school
should
provide
an
overview
of
possible
things
an
individual
could
do
for
living
.

They
They
might
might
go
go
through
through
big
big
troubles
troubles
.
.

Also
,
they
growth
up
from
1960
to
1980
(
10
-
15
%
)
.

Japan
,
UK
and
US
on
the
other
hand
tend
to
reduce
the
wage
gap
.

I
agree
with
this
statement
.

Sweden
reached
a
peak
in
2010
and
was
at
20
%
.

Among
other
reasons
that
showed
a
decrease
are
visit
for
reading
newspapers
or
magazines
and
studying
,
which
constituted
only
5
%
and
2
%
in
2000
respectively
.

After
the
year
of
1995
boes
were
evident
to
suffer
from
beind
overweight
more
than
girls
.

Firstly
,
it
is
noticable
that
the
percentage
of
qualificated
males
mostly
was
higher
that
percentage
of
female
.

As
a
result
,
young
people
are
left
uncontrolled
and
unengaged
.

These
troubles
are
different
and
they
appear
approximately
everyday
.

They
can
relax
and
talking
about
,
for
example
,
political
problems
with
their
friends
improving
their
health
conditions
instead
of
watching
TV
or
playing
computer
games
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
stress
that
space
exploration
has
its
pros
and
cons
.

The
minimum
of
the
temperature
in
this
city
was
fixed
in
July
.

The
biggest
difference
between
these
on
is
about
5
percent
in
2010
(
Sweden
population
have
risen
on
708
percent
while
the
USA
population
stay
constant
)
.

If
it
does
not
happen
,
the
person
hopes
and
expectations
will
be
ruined
and
he
or
she
will
be
regretting
for
the
rest
of
the
life
.

After
that
it
rised
to
10
degrees
C
°
in
July
and
declined
in
December
representing
-
40
degrees
C
°
.

This
sittuation
is
pretty
common
among
the
teen
,
who
are
trying
to
identify
their
personality
.

We
can
also
see
that
selling
of
eBooks
will
probably
increase
in
all
countries
presented
in
the
chart
.

As
a
result
,
it
will
always
come
to
nothing
but
being
after
wrongdoing
,
as
people
who
do
not
have
hobbies
always
gang
up
with
dubious
companies
,
go
wild
and
commit
a
crime
.

Undoubtedly
,
some
people
claim
that
buildings
should
only
serve
the
purpose
,
dispite
the
art
.

The
given
chart
and
table
indicate
the
percentage
of
children
of
both
sexes
who
are
overweight
and
the
percentage
of
children
who
do
exercises
on
regular
basis
.

The
master
want
to
teach
us
,
to
transfer
their
own
experience
and
thoughts
.

In
conclusion
,
the
film
and
music
company
depend
on
money
that
get
from
their
products
.

It
would
be
great
if
teachers
at
schools
could
give
students
lectures
concerning
the
punishment
that
the
crime
is
followed
by
.

The
sportsmens
overcome
human
limits
only
by
using
drugs
.

Nowadays
almost
all
students
who
plan
to
enter
university
after
ending
school
face
a
strange
problem
:
the
majority
of
uni
-
subjects
can
be
devided
into
\"
male
\"
and
\"
female
\"
.

This
essay
discusses
both
the
health
problems
people
have
and
the
ways
of
how
they
can
be
reduced
.

First
of
all
it
is
worth
saying
that
the
average
temperature
is
above
zero
only
for
five
month
a
year
in
Yakutsk
basically
,
whereas
the
average
temperature
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
almost
never
falls
to
the
level
of
20
°
C
.

Chemicals
and
food
products
have
equile
quantity
(
it
is
11
%
)
,
but
on
the
second
diagramm
food
products
have
30
%
(
biggest
quantity
)
and
chemicals
have
16
%
.

First
of
all
,
the
development
of
sport
can
encourage
teenagers
to
refuse
their
bad
habbits
like
drinking
alcohol
and
smoking
and
to
show
them
a
better
way
of
their
personal
development
.

We
should
also
remind
that
this
country
has
the
biggest
change
in
the
data
between
all
the
others
.

I
think
that
it
is
wonderful
if
people
wo
n't
break
the
law
and
wo
n't
be
download
illegal
music
,
but
I
also
think
that
if
person
ca
n't
afford
pay
for
music
,
person
should
n't
be
punished
for
that
,
because
almost
everyone
,
espesially
young
people
,
enjoy
listening
the
music
.

Whether
the
main
world
governments
ought
to
take
certain
measures
to
decrease
the
amount
of
flights
related
to
business
and
leisure
is
a
controversial
issue
worth
discussing
.

The
graph
depicts
unemployment
rate
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
2014
and
2015
and
changes
between
these
two
years
.

For
example
,
in
Brazilian
city
this
figure
reaches
the
low
point
in
July
while
the
average
minimum
temperature
in
Yakutsk
had
the
lowest
figure
in
January
.

Yakutsk
very
quckly
changes
his
temperature
.

While
this
happens
,
authors
get
less
money
than
they
could
,
so
there
is
less
motivation
for
them
to
create
new
interesting
content
.

For
this
thing
.

The
shortest
underground
system
is
in
the
Koyoto
-
11
kilometres
of
route
.

The
majority
amount
of
men
chose
the
skilled
vocational
diploma
.

The
main
problem
of
its
using
is
weakness
of
health
system
,
particularly
heart
problem
.

This
This
illustrates
illustrates
that
that
in
in
this
this
case
case
the
the
cooperation
cooperation
is
is
at
at
its
its
highest
highest
level
level
,
,
which
which
makes
makes
the
the
whole
whole
research
research
process
process
more
more
effective
effective
.
.

In
conclusion
,
to
sumerize
,
I
wanted
to
say
that
each
of
us
is
a
Person
with
a
big
letter
'
P
'
.

The
highest
percentage
of
unemployment
is
in
Northern
Africa
whereas
the
lowest
level
is
in
South
Asia
.

However
,
our
health
is
not
less
important
,
therefore
,
we
should
do
our
best
and
use
all
possible
ways
to
reduce
the
bad
impact
from
gadgets
.

Do
you
remember
what
Beoynce
said
once
?

It
can
be
seen
significant
difference
between
youth
and
middle
aged
population
which
is
more
than
45
percent
.

Furthermore
,
they
can
tell
about
issues
that
exist
in
our
society
in
their
works
.

In
my
opinion
,
that
trend
seems
to
be
right
and
obvious
.

As
can
be
seen
from
the
chart
,
the
largest
percentage
of
vistors
of
the
public
libraries
in
the
UK
in
both
years
(
1999
and
2000
)
borrowed
or
returned
books
in
1999
(
65
%
)
and
in
2000
(
55
%
)
.

However
,
whose
real
responsibility
is
it
?

The
vertical
extant
are
qualification
and
horizontal
-
percentages
.

We
must
remember
all
consequanses
of
using
technologies
.

On
the
first
sight
,
it
is
foreseen
that
profit
from
eBook
production
in
all
countries
would
raise
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
the
most
interesting
situation
is
in
Japan
.

Such
an
idea
is
building
an
orbiting
hotel
in
space
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
leads
the
chart
of
stupidity
.

Sports
these
day
are
developing
as
well
.

It
is
clear
from
the
charts
,
that
the
most
striking
feature
in
transportation
by
rail
is
a
large
proportion
of
metals
-
35
%
of
all
,
whereas
by
road
only
11
%
of
goods
account
for
metals
.

Therefore
,
social
networks
may
be
separated
by
their
audience
into
two
groups
.

More
over
it
easier
to
study
foreign
language
,
because
in
this
step
of
education
children
formed
the
system
of
language
from
his
native
language
,
which
are
obligatory
study
on
primary
level
.

So
,
they
get
problems
with
their
eyes
.

Taking
into
consideration
Italy
,
charts
describes
that
situation
with
0
-
14
years
old
group
will
be
equal
.

The
job
market
situation
in
S.
Asia
is
on
3,9
level
,
that
is
2
points
less
then
the
worldwide
number
.

As
we
can
see
it
has
15
per
cent
of
men
and
only
8
per
cent
of
women
.

Talking
about
postgraduate
diploma
,
there
is
a
significant
difference
in
number
of
men
and
women
with
that
degree
:
70
%
of
males
have
current
diploma
,
at
the
same
time
only
30
%
of
females
own
it
.

In
addition
,
one
of
space
exploratoin
's
issues
is
to
find
appropriate
living
conditionds
on
other
planets
.

There
is
a
common
perception
that
the
internationall
organizations
,
such
as
UN
and
its
councils
,
can
not
make
anything
today
to
minimalize
the
confrontation
and
prevent
conflicts
.

People
deside
to
have
a
life
-
style
like
popular
persons
and
stars
have
.

Despite
that
,
other
countries
have
rather
lower
incomes
.

While
in
Italy
,
the
minimal
percentage
of
population
is
0
-
14
years
and
it
is
14,3
%
.

Also
if
ecology
polution
is
decrease
people
will
be
more
helthy
.

For
example
,
teachers
in
schools
should
be
more
attentive
with
them
.

It
makes
people
's
life
easier
,
cheapier
and
faster
and
earlier
than
official
release
.

There
is
no
doubt
,
that
people
who
work
in
art
industry
lose
lots
of
there
money
because
they
have
not
enough
protection
.

For
example
,
I
've
read
about
person
,
who
has
more
male
interests
that
female
's
ones
and
behave
herself
according
to
rules
,
which
society
always
consideres
as
male
one
.

People
tend
to
communicate
more
at
work
,
stressed
because
of
endless
phone
calls
,
but
at
the
same
time
feelings
of
isolation
occur
.

It
used
to
be
11
in
Middle
East
and
6,8
in
Latin
America
in
2014
.

That
is
why
not
only
a
growth
of
the
number
of
sports
facilities
is
needed
to
improve
public
health
,
but
also
an
extention
of
the
idea
of
healthy
lifestyle
.

Obviously
,
the
first
reason
has
the
most
significant
meaning
for
students
who
are
under
26
and
it
decreases
from
one
age
group
to
another
.

And
that
is
why
the
USSR
was
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
with
ideal
economic
.

It
is
fair
to
mention
,
that
alcohol
and
drugs
are
world
-
renowned
and
it
really
influences
the
situation
.

For
example
,
it
is
a
common
tendency
,
that
more
girls
go
for
education
to
the
law
faculties
.

There
is
an
opinion
in
out
society
that
special
characteristics
can
influence
on
our
personality
and
development
.

Moreoverm
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
will
be
encouraged
to
harmony
in
study
process
,
which
will
not
allow
to
develop
just
male
or
female
features
with
students
.

They
take
only
the
15
percent
.

In
a
modern
society
it
is
usually
claimed
that
the
amount
of
crimes
,
which
were
permitted
by
the
youngers
,
rocked
to
a
significant
high
.

In
the
first
diagram
I
can
see
that
the
metals
are
the
most
popular
good
transported
by
rail
,
whereas
in
the
second
diagramm
I
can
see
that
food
products
transported
by
road
more
often
than
other
types
of
goods
.

In
addition
,
young
generation
are
encouraged
to
use
technical
gadgets
by
schools
and
universities
in
order
to
enhance
the
efficiency
of
the
work
.

Their
aim
for
studying
and
how
they
are
supported
by
employers
.

The
percentage
of
population
aged
65
and
over
in
USA
is
guaducelly
increasing
during
this
100
years
like
in
Sweden
.

Generally
speaking
,
a
close
connection
between
date
of
opening
and
the
length
of
the
railway
can
be
noticed
in
5
out
of
6
cities
.

In
my
opinion
,
life
experience
has
the
major
influence
on
people
's
personalities
.

It
accords
to
the
situation
in
which
number
of
male
students
will
more
than
female
.

They
both
play
role
in
child
's
life
,
and
that
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
child
's
future
without
powerful
participation
of
both
of
these
parts
.

Despite
the
fact
that
sport
has
good
influense
on
our
health
and
helps
us
to
avoid
obesity
,
for
instance
,
it
will
not
treat
stomach
-
ache
,
head
-
ache
and
we
have
to
drink
some
medical
drugs
.

Some
people
believe
that
rise
of
using
modern
technology
causes
the
increasing
number
of
health
problems
.

In
consequences
they
lose
a
lot
of
money
from
illegal
pirate
copies
.

The
line
graphs
provide
information
about
highest
and
lowest
temperature
levels
in
Yakutsk
,
Russia
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.

For
instance
,
one
film
producer
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
power
for
making
film
,
however
,
people
download
it
and
do
not
go
to
the
cinemas
,
do
not
pay
for
original
discs
.

By
the
way
,
planes
are
the
most
safely
transport
in
the
world
.

The
number
of
men
who
had
Postgraduate
diploma
and
Master
's
diploma
40
per
cent
and
20
per
cent
more
than
the
number
of
women
accordingly
.

Now
we
can
say
that
defenition
of
happiness
is
unique
and
personalized
.

I
suppose
that
we
should
give
everyone
a
second
chance
.

The
most
popular
type
of
goods
delivered
by
rail
is
manufactured
goods
(
25
%
)
and
by
road
the
are
transported
particularly
as
often
(
28
%
)
.

More
over
,
happiness
is
a
feeling
when
you
achieve
success
.

USA
decrease
dramaticaly
since
1980
to
1995
years
and
it
lost
near
20
%
.

Every
person
is
individual
and
everyone
has
special
skills
.

Secondly
,
I
believe
that
countries
can
lose
profit
and
good
relations
with
other
countries
without
import
and
export
.

When
we
look
at
the
chart
,
we
can
notice
a
tendency
that
print
books
more
popular
at
all
countries
shown
in
2014
.

Overall
,
the
general
trend
of
both
diagrams
is
having
higher
percentage
in
the
number
of
manufactured
goods
and
chemicals
.

Secondly
,
sometimes
private
companies
prefer
to
pay
for
researches
that
they
find
beneficial
for
themselves
,
for
the
prosperity
of
their
entreprise
.

As
a
result
,
historical
buildings
,
modern
ones
made
of
plastic
,
concrete
and
glass
stand
side
by
side
.

Marina
Abramovich
keep
money
on
the
safe
of
the
our
planet
,
she
take
video
perfomcences
and
then
sell
it
.

Two
years
it
is
very
good
period
for
reabelitation
athlets
health
and
powers
.

In
conclusion
,
according
to
the
graph
males
had
the
most
quantity
qualification
in
skilled
vocational
.

As
a
result
,
young
people
will
be
afraid
of
the
punishment
,
having
real
-
life
examples
in
front
of
their
eyes
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
essential
to
notice
that
both
views
have
well
-
adjusted
logic
behind
them
and
therefore
should
be
equally
respected
.

On
the
one
side
,
such
propotiton
makes
both
sexes
equal
in
their
rights
and
thus
helps
to
decrease
irigrality
in
our
society
.

First
of
all
,
architecture
is
a
part
of
art
and
we
should
not
forget
this
.

The
eastern
civilisation
also
had
a
beautiful
architecture
with
its
Mosque
,
ornaments
and
the
beauty
of
a
colour
of
blue
.

In
addition
,
I
think
that
just
increasing
the
number
of
sport
facilities
can
help
improve
public
health
only
in
short
run
.

The
figure
is
3,9
%
there
.

Overall
,
it
could
be
seen
a
trend
that
in
all
countries
the
proportion
of
the
population
aged
65
and
over
has
been
increasing
during
the
period
.

They
can
not
produce
enough
food
to
their
own
population
,
but
they
have
another
resourses
,
that
they
can
sell
on
the
world
market
and
for
his
money
have
able
to
buy
the
foods
.

Without
restrictions
some
problems
may
appear
since
some
art
works
contain
the
idea
which
are
nit
suitable
for
children
and
government
's
laws
.

Nowadays
it
is
becoming
cosier
to
express
yourself
by
different
ways
.

The
percentage
of
women
who
use
Facebook
for
sharing
photos
and
videos
is
much
higher
than
the
percentage
of
men
who
use
this
social
network
for
the
same
reason
:
54
%
versus
39
%
.

Also
,
people
should
reduce
time
,
which
is
spent
for
devices
.

The
pie
charts
demonstrate
the
percentage
of
people
of
three
different
age
groups
who
attended
science
,
atrs
and
sports
and
health
courses
in
2012
in
one
of
the
UK
colleges
The
main
age
groups
presented
are
the
elderly
who
are
40
or
older
,
the
middle
-
aged
who
are
at
the
age
from
26
to
40
and
the
youth
beginning
from
18
and
up
to
25
years
old
.

Manufactured
goods
took
one
quarter
of
the
chart
.

The
situation
in
Middle
East
is
approximately
the
same
in
2014
.

Who
knows
,
maybe
we
will
be
able
to
find
a
new
type
of
fuel
while
exploring
space
.
that
will
not
only
help
people
to
save
money
,
but
maybe
it
also
will
help
to
save
the
planet
.

For
example
,
special
equipment
could
break
and
governments
will
waste
money
.

The
charts
provide
information
about
travelling
abroad
by
Englishmen
and
visits
to
the
UK
by
foreigners
from
1979
to
1999
as
well
as
the
most
popular
countries
which
UK
residents
went
to
in
1999
.

Consequantly
,
there
is
a
need
to
think
about
possible
factors
which
influence
on
happiness
.

In
conclusion
,
while
after
80th
amount
of
travels
started
to
grow
,
France
and
Spain
became
the
most
popular
countries
for
visiting
.

The
information
is
given
in
billions
of
US
dollars
.

Nowadays
a
lot
of
people
argues
,
how
to
improve
people
's
health
.

Firstly
,
in
such
places
like
the
school
or
the
university
,
the
young
gets
acquainted
with
many
new
people
with
different
social
backgrounds
,
points
of
view
,
interests
,
habits
,
and
,
as
a
consequence
,
while
interacting
with
them
,
the
child
undergoes
several
changes
in
his
/
her
own
personality
and
starts
acquiring
new
interests
,
hobbies
,
habits
,
etc
.

A
boom
is
shown
in
the
European
Union
where
the
unemployment
rate
climbed
from
7,5
to
7,9
percent
.

They
should
produce
food
not
only
for
themselves
but
for
people
in
different
countries
who
can
not
allow
it
.

We
can
not
decline
their
utility
however
we
should
have
some
limits
of
their
using
.

Nowadays
,
there
are
many
sites
in
the
Internet
in
which
people
can
listen
to
music
or
watch
films
for
free
.

Conversely
,
some
people
will
disagree
with
my
point
of
view
.

Secondly
,
there
are
a
lot
of
goods
,
which
transported
by
road
.

By
rail
we
lost
35
%
money
,
its
bigger
then
by
road
because
RZD
needs
more
capital
for
new
any
politics
dacha
for
example
.

Turning
to
incresed
position
,
we
can
point
out
China
and
India
.

European
Union
was
the
only
region
where
this
rate
slightly
growth
from
7,5
%
to
7,9
%
.

Therefore
,
in
order
to
bring
up
environmentally
conscious
new
generation
we
should
approve
spending
time
outdoors
.
parents
may
be
make
picnics
in
the
countryside
or
organise
various
leisure
activities
at
the
surbabian
area
thus
forming
the
interest
of
a
child
in
exploring
the
natural
world
.

Firstly
,
we
can
rearrange
transporting
use
as
more
environmentally
-
friendly
.

So
they
become
the
participants
of
the
illegal
act
.

But
we
should
also
consider
that
\"
all
the
unconvinient
activity
should
be
performed
in
convinient
way
\"
,
it
meens
that
according
to
the
law
and
government
's
permission
.

Moreover
,
he
became
stronger
.

The
widespread
of
it
guarantees
variety
of
health
problems
,
and
this
variety
is
increasing
.

In
today
's
fast
-
moring
world
development
of
a
person
plays
one
of
the
most
important
role
in
a
life
of
every
man
,
as
through
it
we
socialize
and
educate
.

One
of
the
problems
is
the
rays
that
are
produced
by
your
devices
.

It
could
be
clearly
seen
,
that
the
rate
of
unemployment
decreased
significantly
in
two
regions
.

The
circle
graph
illustrate
the
ways
of
using
electricity
in
simple
English
home
.

Over
the
period
the
levels
of
males
rised
in
undergraduate
diploma
and
Bachelor
's
degree
qualification
.

To
put
it
in
a
nutshell
,
it
is
not
possible
to
decrease
committing
crimes
among
young
people
immediately
,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
productive
ways
to
do
it
.

Some
people
believe
that
governments
should
invest
money
in
local
film
companies
in
order
to
change
this
situation
.

It
is
just
intertainment
.

In
this
essay
I
would
like
to
analyse
both
points
of
view
.

And
some
people
believe
that
countries
should
produce
food
only
for
their
need
and
not
to
export
it
.

However
,
there
are
some
ways
to
tackle
this
problems
.

In
this
way
,
creative
people
should
use
some
conventional
forms
of
performans
and
it
should
n't
contain
some
extremistic
or
radical
ideas
.

Also
,
the
biggest
percentages
of
population
in
2050
in
Yemen
will
be
15
-
59
years
old
people
.

It
is
important
to
notice
,
that
in
all
the
years
there
will
be
the
biggest
amount
of
people
from
15
to
59
years
in
Italy
.

First
of
all
,
the
cause
of
the
great
number
of
health
problems
is
not
the
technology
,
but
overusing
technology
in
life
.

The
equal
number
of
men
and
women
can
be
a
solution
to
this
problem
,
because
a
person
will
feel
he
or
she
is
not
alone
and
will
always
find
a
company
.

Differnet
people
have
differnet
values
.

Statistics
over
the
world
did
n't
change
-
the
rate
stayed
the
same
.

Another
part
of
society
suppouse
that
using
of
illegal
drugs
in
serious
and
unexused
mistake
for
professional
sportsmen
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
longest
route
of
railway
is
394
kilometres
for
London
's
underground
system
.

Second
,
we
see
importance
of
geographical
placement
.

First
of
all
,
the
total
number
of
students
is
almost
the
same
in
every
branch
,
from
600
students
attending
arts
courses
to
650
students
who
chose
science
courses
.

There
is
a
nive
expression
:
\"
Sport
is
movement
\"
.

Besides
,
the
amounts
of
adults
(
26
-
40
years
old
)
from
science
and
arts
course
are
approximately
equel
(
nearly
a
quater
of
all
students
attending
the
courses
)
.

Moreover
,
industry
is
familiar
for
male
workers
in
both
countries
and
consists
32
%
in
Australia
and
15
%
for
Indonesia
.

Scientits
say
that
computer
games
have
got
a
lot
of
advantages
,
but
also
disadvantages
,
for
example
agressive
behaviour
.

Thirdly
,
when
there
are
no
sports
facilities
,
young
people
always
look
for
another
activities
and
they
are
not
always
good
,
mostly
they
are
harmful
to
people
.

From
that
time
,
it
has
slowly
been
declining
.

Some
people
say
that
athletes
caught
using
illegal
drugs
should
leave
professional
competing
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
,
others
are
sure
that
a
limited
period
of
banning
of
those
athletes
is
enough
.

The
charts
represent
the
data
about
goods
transportations
by
rail
and
by
road
.

The
same
15
%
percent
are
18
-
25
year
olds
at
sports
and
health
courses
.

To
colclude
,
widespread
use
of
modern
technology
can
not
be
the
main
reason
of
health
proplems
.

We
should
be
more
active
during
our
work
on
computers
,
we
should
seat
properly
on
the
desks
.

We
can
notice
that
peolpe
around
30
years
old
are
not
into
art
(
25
%
)
.

As
can
be
seen
from
the
charts
,
metals
are
usually
transported
by
rail
and
food
goods
are
delivered
by
road
.

Almost
free
access
to
the
gyms
makes
possible
for
lots
of
youngsters
and
grown
-
ups
to
participate
in
healthy
activities
.

And
when
affecting
it
does
not
change
the
situation
the
only
way
is
to
get
help
from
the
governers
of
other
countries
.

Not
so
many
people
see
that
happiness
as
their
aim
and
goal
but
realise
,
that
going
towards
hapiness
can
lead
them
from
some
other
,
also
valuable
reachings
.

There
are
other
points
of
view
that
will
be
reflected
in
this
essay
.

This
graph
illustrates
how
energy
from
fossil
fuels
changing
in
several
different
territories
.

No
doubt
that
it
has
a
good
influence
on
their
health
as
their
organisms
are
used
to
get
such
kinds
of
food
.

Older
people
tend
to
use
networks
less
than
the
others
.

You
do
n't
know
what
happiness
os
until
you
experience
it
and
each
time
it
can
be
caused
differently
.

This
means
that
these
systems
have
been
developing
since
the
previous
century
and
,
as
a
result
,
have
longer
routs
.

The
percentage
of
transported
chemicals
is
a
little
bigger
than
in
the
first
one
(
16
%
)
.

In
Yemen
the
number
of
people
over
60
is
extremely
low
but
probably
will
rise
by
2050
(
from
3,6
%
to
5,7
%
)
.

The
number
of
caus
increase
every
day
.

To
sum
up
,
special
laws
should
be
established
to
protects
the
rights
of
producers
and
provide
various
products
for
people
's
use
.

56
men
and
49
women
in
Indonesia
compared
to
65
males
and
88
females
in
Australia
.

The
quantity
of
eBook
production
also
drastically
changed
.

It
depends
on
their
climate
,
finance
,
technological
development
and
political
situation
.

The
given
bar
chart
shows
the
level
of
unemployed
people
in
six
selected
regions
of
the
world
.

The
problem
of
high
popularity
of
pirate
content
appeared
not
so
long
ago
but
everyone
has
to
deal
with
it
in
the
postmodern
era
.

Secondly
,
people
who
copy
original
files
without
any
permission
decrease
the
income
of
musicians
or
film
producers
.

Many
people
know
that
male
students
prefer
technical
and
math
way
,
while
the
majority
part
of
female
students
choose
humanitarian
subjects
.

Now
my
sister
never
throws
any
litter
.

The
investigation
of
Russian
research
company
\"
Health
today
\"
in
2010
revealed
that
having
at
least
2
days
per
week
for
outdoor
activities
is
necessary
to
reduce
the
influence
of
modern
technologies
on
health
.

For
instanse
,
while
in
1990
the
second
-
popular
activity
was
reading
newspapers
and
magazines
,
which
attracted
15
%
of
all
visitors
,
in
2000
the
main
reason
to
come
to
a
public
library
after
returning
or
taking
books
was
to
find
information
,
which
was
the
ground
for
every
fifth
visit
,
unlike
1990
when
it
attracted
only
every
tenth
visitor
.

People
who
do
crime
should
be
punished
.

That
's
why
the
remains
will
be
just
destroyed
.

It
all
should
be
legal
for
up
-
and
-
coming
artists
as
well
as
to
professionalists
.

Due
to
this
openess
people
is
highly
affected
by
popular
trends
and
people
in
Internet
.

On
the
other
hand
,
I
believe
that
people
will
more
likely
never
do
a
crime
if
they
are
not
pushed
to
it
by
the
environment
and
society
around
them
.

In
conclusion
,
the
most
popular
levels
of
qualifications
among
males
are
skilled
vocational
diploma
and
postgraduate
diploma
.

Some
people
associate
it
with
understanding
of
the
sense
of
life
or
,
on
the
other
hand
,
wiyh
a
worthless
aim
.

However
,
there
are
many
a
serious
disadvantages
.

For
example
:
in
my
school
I
educated
in
the
class
of
girls
.

It
is
a
golden
rule
of
happiness
.

Unfortunately
,
the
lack
of
universal
behaviour
rules
and
cultural
difference
can
cause
arguments
and
conflicts
between
teachers
and
parents
The
third
key
to
the
problem
of
youth
criminals
is
adding
more
severe
punishments
for
the
young
intruders
.

The
main
problem
of
course
is
that
in
building
sphere
investors
and
other
peopeles
which
are
involved
in
process
are
mostly
think
about
moneys
,
not
about
beauty
.

Two
percent
of
road
transportation
was
held
by
machinery
.

For
example
,
if
I
have
talent
to
poetry
,
it
helps
me
to
became
successful
in
the
literature
.

However
,
females
did
not
their
best
at
this
level
and
there
is
observed
the
smallest
number
of
them
(
about
15
%
)
.

The
worldwide
level
stayed
similar
,
too
.

To
conclude
,
this
essay
supports
the
idea
of
a
number
of
health
problems
caused
by
overuse
of
new
technologies
.

Otherwise
money
would
be
waste
and
people
would
continue
be
sick
.

In
distinguish
LinkedIn
is
popular
rather
among
old
people
than
among
young
people
.

There
are
very
much
disscus
of
its
topic
.

But
the
worsening
of
the
vision
is
not
the
last
problem
with
intense
usage
of
gadgets
.

Obviously
,
young
people
are
eager
to
get
some
experience
which
might
come
in
handy
in
the
future
.

In
Russia
,
temperature
has
both
minus
and
above
zero
markes
.

In
the
Internet
there
are
some
photos
from
Sweden
prison
.

Due
to
that
some
people
claim
that
countries
and
governments
should
only
take
care
of
their
own
citizents
as
it
is
quite
problematic
to
help
everyone
.

However
,
there
are
a
couple
of
drawbacks
of
this
idea
.

It
also
shown
,
that
the
60
+
years
old
will
remain
constant
-
about
4
-
5
per
cent
.

The
reason
,
of
such
unpopularity
,
is
quite
simple
.

All
in
all
,
even
if
we
eventually
grow
up
not
those
who
our
parents
wanted
us
to
be
,
I
am
sure
we
would
never
become
who
we
are
now
without
their
effort
.

So
in
this
case
it
's
quite
a
reasonable
idea
to
provide
people
with
even
minimal
extent
of
money
so
they
can
overcome
these
times
and
survive
.

In
conclusion
,
we
see
that
in
both
english
-
speaking
countries
the
number
of
ebooks
will
outweight
their
alternatives
in2018
.

Beginning
with
Yemen
,
it
can
be
clearly
seen
,
that
the
number
of
people
in
middle
age
in
2050
in
comparison
to
2000
is
projected
to
increase
at
11
percent
and
the
number
of
people
from
0
to
14
years
will
decrease
at
13
percent
.

To
sum
up
,
all
of
three
countries
reaches
the
pick
in
2040
.

The
first
hight
that
needs
to
be
said
is
the
majority
of
people
think
that
creative
artists
must
have
big
talant
and
they
have
created
ideas
.

The
graph
hesitate
and
to
2040
year
is
24
%
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
the
building
does
not
need
to
look
like
a
work
or
art
,
as
it
is
more
important
for
a
building
to
serve
its
purpose
.

The
drastic
feature
of
this
problem
is
its
across
-
the
-
board
spread
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
the
general
factors
of
being
happy
are
the
same
.

By
the
year
1978
the
production
of
energy
increased
from
60
to
70
percent
and
then
started
to
rise
gradually
and
reached
88
percent
by
the
end
of
the
period
.

The
results
for
career
reason
slide
from
80
%
according
to
young
people
under
26
to
17
%
according
to
the
elderely
,
who
is
over
49
.

The
given
table
shows
the
data
about
famous
social
networks
and
the
use
of
them
by
American
users
.

However
,
some
people
claim
that
illegal
copying
and
sharing
different
types
of
art
is
an
essential
action
and
should
not
be
punished
.

And
the
growing
proportion
of
the
young
people
here
can
be
explained
by
the
absence
of
true
crime
in
the
eyes
of
young
criminals
,
which
,
so
to
say
,
legalize
such
actions
.

But
if
we
believe
scientists
,
all
people
are
the
same
,
and
there
are
no
problem
of
gender
in
our
life
,
but
in
real
life
we
see
the
other
picture
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
rate
slowly
increased
in
the
EU
from
7,5
per
cent
to
7,9
per
cent
.

As
example
,
is
the
story
about
my
father
and
his
brother
-
Mikle
.

In
this
situation
school
and
parents
should
be
together
.

The
most
popular
network
among
them
is
still
Facebook
,
whereas
they
are
interested
in
Instagram
much
less
than
the
youngest
ones
:
25
%
and
11
%
against
53
%
of
the
youth
.

If
the
government
strengthens
the
drug
struggle
policy
and
raises
the
prices
for
tobacco
goods
and
alcoholic
drinks
,
there
definitely
will
be
less
crime
.

Taking
in
account
the
fluctuations
of
unemployment
rate
of
regions
presented
,
the
worldwide
unemployment
rate
kept
stable
from
2014
to
2015
and
equals
5,9
%
,
which
is
closest
to
the
one
of
Latin
America
in
2015
.

It
's
graph
reaches
the
highest
point
of
42
%
in
1985
,
but
stays
the
highest
even
in
1995
with
30
%
differece
.

Secondly
,
social
life
can
be
more
interesting
and
different
with
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
students
.

I
think
it
is
not
rational
way
,
because
of
it
can
decrease
the
economical
situation
in
the
world
,
because
business
men
will
not
be
able
in
rapid
time
to
resolve
their
business
works
and
development
will
stops
.

So
the
yongest
part
of
the
male
interwiewers
spent
282,1
minutes
on
exercise
and
sport
and
the
female
part
of
them
spent
114,1
minutes
,
whereas
the
oldest
men
could
do
it
just
for
29,2
mintues
and
oldest
women
just
for
10
minutes
.

Yet
Yet
,
,
there
there
are
are
some
some
other
other
effective
effective
measures
measures
that
that
may
may
alter
alter
the
the
outcome
outcome
.
.

At
the
meantime
the
70
%
of
females
have
undergraduate
diploma
.

In
our
contemporary
world
It
is
widely
considered
that
watching
different
sport
events
or
participating
in
diverse
tournaments
is
a
waste
of
time
.

However
,
I
think
that
sometimes
we
need
to
have
some
tome
for
ourselves
.

Europe
is
the
only
region
on
the
graph
that
had
such
a
situation
.

Also
,
there
might
well
be
a
problem
with
changing
interests
and
requests
during
the
year
without
studying
,
For
example
,
being
upset
with
his
faults
,
when
a
subject
is
too
difficult
,
a
person
can
change
his
mind
about
becoming
a
programmer
.

And
According
to
some
statistics
,
every
third
person
in
Russia
suffers
from
obesity
.

In
this
essay
I
am
going
to
write
about
the
most
powerful
causes
and
try
to
make
some
suggestions
how
to
deal
with
this
problem
.

Another
good
example
is
microwave
,
the
device
,
that
some
people
ca
n't
leave
without
.

Modern
medechine
can
with
cancer
.

So
we
can
see
that
such
group
of
population
as
teenagers
grow
from
2000
to
2050
in
Yemen
if
the
orognozes
come
truth
.

To
begin
with
,
many
people
claim
that
without
money
life
is
boring
.

However
,
if
one
is
aware
and
educated
enough
,
he
is
always
able
to
save
someone
's
life
by
spreading
positive
messages
and
helping
those
in
need
.

For
instance
,
SKOLKOVO
lab
in
Moscow
that
is
sponsored
by
the
government
and
has
a
privilage
number
of
all
the
newest
instuments
for
research
does
not
correspond
with
expectations
that
were
made
by
the
authorities
.

Secondly
Secondly
,
,
the
the
specific
specific
,
,
sometimes
sometimes
peculiar
peculiar
design
design
of
of
the
the
buildings
buildings
makes
makes
the
the
whole
whole
city
city
look
look
different
different
.
.

If
we
would
speak
about
\"
most
female
\"
level
of
education
it
will
be
the
undergraduate
diploma
.

It
should
not
be
denyed
that
sport
also
make
people
closer
to
each
other
,
happier
and
healthier
.

First
of
all
,
it
is
pretty
hard
to
form
the
definition
of
happiness
.

Comparing
2000
year
with
2050
the
tendency
is
clear
-
the
percentage
of
middle
-
aged
people
will
grow
for
approximately
10
%
reducing
youngsters
for
13
%
in
Yemen
.

At
the
same
time
,
third
ant
forth
position
belongs
to
TV
,
radio
and
vacuum
cleaners
(
15
percent
)
.

Is
important
to
pay
attention
to
opening
the
underground
railway
station
in
London
.

This
graph
provides
us
the
information
about
the
proportion
of
people
who
are
over
65
in
USA
,
Sweden
and
Japan
.

Should
governments
give
more
financial
support
to
local
film
industries
?

Taking
everything
above
into
consideration
,
I
ca
n't
say
,
that
situation
is
going
better
in
the
most
regions
,
but
in
Middle
East
and
Latin
America
there
is
a
tendention
to
lowering
the
unemployment
.

My
sistars
ofther
try
to
repeat
what
they
have
watched
or
imaginate
something
similar
.

Moreover
,
the
problem
is
that
such
country
could
even
disappear
if
other
developed
countries
would
not
help
.

So
,
every
age
group
is
interested
in
Facebook
,
Instagram
is
founded
for
the
youngest
group
and
the
privilege
amount
of
users
of
Linked
In
are
from
30
to
64
years
.

In
Yemen
there
is
about
50,1
%
of
teens
in
2000
and
37
%
is
predicted
in
2050
.

In
my
opinion
,
people
easy
could
change
by
developing
different
sides
of
life
.

One
convincing
example
is
special
places
where
criminals
can
realize
their
intensions
not
in
a
harmful
way
;
for
example
,
they
can
,
being
under
control
of
doctors
and
policemen
,
take
care
about
seniors
or
children
.

However
volume
transported
by
road
were
higher
at
about
13
%
.

Moreover
,
they
are
said
to
be
very
sensitive
and
their
emotions
and
feelings
should
n't
be
affected
by
any
restrictions
otherwise
they
can
lose
their
artist
spark
.

First
of
all
,
why
do
people
always
want
to
be
in
charge
and
roll
in
money
?

Having
started
with
the
rates
of
80
-
90
approximately
,
France
and
Sweden
had
started
to
fall
in
1980
with
slight
fluctuations
during
the
period
and
had
reached
the
lowest
point
by
2015
,
meanwhile
United
States
'
rates
had
not
changed
significantly
,
but
lost
the
leading
position
.

Firstly
,
a
person
who
just
steals
these
files
from
web
-
sites
,
denies
to
admit
and
take
into
account
all
the
work
that
thousands
of
people
have
done
while
creating
a
movie
or
a
music
album
,
and
also
all
the
money
,
which
were
spent
on
turning
these
projects
into
life
.

In
conclusion
,
despite
some
advantages
of
producing
the
food
for
native
people
,
I
mostly
disagree
with
the
statement
because
of
the
impact
that
world
trade
has
on
the
economy
in
different
countries
and
the
lack
of
the
products
in
countries
where
it
is
impossible
to
grow
enough
food
for
population
which
can
lead
to
the
hungry
and
unsatisfaction
nation
.

According
to
the
chart
in
2030
there
will
be
great
rise
of
number
of
people
whose
age
is
65
and
over
.

There
are
a
lot
of
discussions
among
scientists
and
other
people
about
what
is
more
crucial
for
our
personal
development
:
the
characteristics
from
our
birth
or
others
that
we
get
during
our
lives
.

In
their
opinion
it
is
absolutely
unacceptable
to
have
people
with
such
reputation
of
cheaters
on
any
country
's
team
,
when
there
has
to
be
somebody
else
with
same
results
reached
with
the
help
of
natural
abilities
.

Also
we
can
notice
that
metals
and
machinery
offen
transported
by
rail
.

Moreover
all
these
TV
shows
about
politics
which
have
not
an
age
border
,
in
such
programms
they
can
see
how
adult
people
can
be
agresssive
and
can
not
controll
themselves
.

In
this
countries
difference
unemployment
rate
fluctuated
around
2
-
3
percent
2014
-
2015
years
.

Since
the
internet
has
appeared
and
after
some
years
of
its
development
it
became
an
everyday
practice
for
users
to
find
and
download
films
and
music
for
free
.

However
,
there
are
some
negative
effects
.

Firstly
,
people
should
reduce
their
desire
to
be
able
to
consume
every
popular
or
fashionable
piece
of
modern
technology
in
order
just
to
blend
in
a
crowd
and
not
to
feel
sorry
for
yourself
not
having
a
new
expensive
toy
to
play
.

On
the
other
hand
,
people
choose
time
with
family
and
friends
.

I
suppose
,
it
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
females
tend
to
think
about
their
children
,
not
concentrating
on
the
post
-
school
qualifications
.

The
overview
was
made
in
1999
.

Another
significant
cause
of
such
behavior
is
considered
to
be
peer
pressure
.

From
1980
to
2015
the
percent
of
energy
from
fossil
fuels
in
such
countries
as
France
and
Sweden
was
dramatically
dropping
(
in
2015
the
figures
are
less
than
50
%
and
less
than
30
%
respectively
)
,
whereas
in
India
(
in
2015
slightly
more
than
70
%
)
and
China
there
was
a
rise
,
and
China
in
the
year
of
2015
was
the
country
that
use
energy
from
fossil
fuels
more
than
other
counries
with
just
under
90
%
.

Soon
the
authors
were
caught
and
surprisingly
they
were
youngsters
too
.

But
on
the
other
hand
,
girls
seems
to
be
more
responsible
,
for
their
studies
so
usually
they
have
better
results
of
exams
and
so
they
have
more
opportunities
to
get
a
place
in
the
university
.

In
our
time
Internet
the
most
popular
place
where
we
spend
out
time
and
make
different
things
like
watching
film
and
listening
musics
Furthermore
,
not
all
people
can
buy
the
original
disc
with
music
and
films
,
when
in
the
websites
there
are
free
versions
.

The
second
place
is
\"
industry
\"
approximately
32
%
of
male
and
11
%
of
female
workers
.

That
's
why
in
such
situations
other
countries
should
provide
certain
assist
.

All
of
us
understand
that
for
giving
a
job
you
need
to
have
a
special
education
.

There
is
nothing
to
do
in
order
to
improve
that
type
of
nature
,
but
some
changes
can
be
done
.

The
difference
between
the
reality
and
imagined
world
is
gone
for
young
people
.

More
people
are
going
to
live
abroad
,
more
families
are
creating
form
different
coultures
.
in
that
case
I
ca
n't
agree
that
food
isolation
in
the
country
is
nescessary
.

Nevertheless
,
average
difference
between
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
is
lower
in
Yakutsk
.

People
,
who
prefer
healthy
lifestyle
and
regular
trainings
will
find
an
opportunity
to
do
sports
in
any
case
.

It
reached
12,5
%
,
and
in
2015
this
indicator
remained
stable
.

However
,
if
there
did
not
exist
architecture
works
of
art
,
there
would
be
quite
difficult
to

Also
,
people
will
have
more
activities
in
their
lives
,
because
today
we
just
go
to
work
or
study
and
back
.

People
also
transported
the
same
amount
of
chemicals
between
countries
,
11
%
by
rail
and
16
%
by
road
.

Moreover
,
film
industry
in
America
is
the
greatest
one
,
so
it
is
sponsored
well
and
has
an
experience
in
producing
the
best
films
in
history
.

I
suppose
this
is
not
the
best
goal
because
we
should
focus
on
preventing
such
a
situation
and
caring
about
everybody
's
lives
instead
of
making
sure
there
is
a
way
to
escape
for
some
outstanding
individuals
.

So
many
people
believe
,
that
reducing
the
amount
of
air
travel
will
help
to
make
the
air
cleaner
.

School
children
neglect
many
school
rules
as
well
as
miss
a
lot
of
classes
.

Some
part
of
humanity
thinks
that
countries
should
import
to
other
countries
a
minimum
part
of
food
which
produces
in
this
country
,
And
the
food
should
be
the
same
value
with
food
which
population
needs
.

This
problem
can
be
solved
by
creating
a
computer
or
monitor
which
will
not
have
such
bad
impact
.

Because
of
such
situation
the
level
of
economics
in
the
particular
region
declines
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
very
important
to
find
solutions
to
problems
with
students
'
behaviour
due
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
strong
link
between
students
'
behaviour
and
their
inner
world
.

However
,
the
prediction
for
Italy
is
not
so
positive
,
because
the
number
of
people
aged
60
+
years
is
going
to
be
almost
doubled
.

I
fully
disagree
with
this
statement
.

It
can
be
not
in
a
serious
way
,
but
it
should
be
in
every
family
.

To
sum
up
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
local
shops
have
some
benefits
,
but
in
our
modern
world
it
is
better
to
open
large
brands
,
which
includes
almost
everything
in
it
.

They
see
only
negative
forms
,
they
do
not
try
do
the
best
and
find
company
or
groups
of
people
who
think
the
same
.

Because
when
you
spend
all
your
time
at
work
,
you
have
not
enough
time
to
live
.

What
comes
to
me
,
I
ca
n't
always
permit
to
myself
buying
some
album
or
film
that
's
why
I
use
illegal
files
from
the
Internet
like
all
people
.

They
ca
n't
learn
and
understand
tenses
,
because
it
is
too
hard
for
them
.

But
,
for
my
opinion
,
it
would
be
efficient
for
all
citizens
in
the
county
,
if
the
pirate
sites
would
be
allowed
for
them
.

In
Worldwide
the
unemployment
index
remains
stable
at
the
point
5,9
percent
during
the
period
.

After
this
point
it
is
seen
the
growth
of
elder
people
's
percentage
in
three
countries
.

Before
2010
the
number
of
people
over
65
was
not
so
dramatic
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
this
tendency
has
more
disadvantages
than
positive
sides
.

If
you
eat
this
food
once
,
you
will
want
it
in
the
future
.

Lattes
political
events
and
legislative
initiatives
have
raised
certain
vital
problem
of
government
restrictions
in
the
acts
.

Furthemore
,
some
teens
do
n't
last
their
education
due
to
some
problems
such
as
family
issues
.

In
our
busy
world
the
issue
of
peoples
health
is
one
of
the
main
problems
.

Overall
,
we
can
see
on
this
graph
the
main
trends
in
development
of
underground
railway
system
in
different
megapolises
from
the
begining
.

However
,
just
after
the
release
of
new
film
somebody
copies
it
and
wide
audience
has
an
opportunity
to
watch
it
free
.

Nevertheless
,
there
are
many
ways
to
cope
with
this
problem
.

However
,
there
is
a
serious
increase
in
the
population
of
people
aged
65
from
3
%
in
1985
to
28
%
in
2040
.

That
is
why
I
prefer
to
attend
Mathematics
while
other
girls
in
my
group
choose
English
or
culture
.

Nowadays
the
problem
of
pirate
content
is
very
widespread
.

A
good
example
of
this
is
the
war
in
Syria
,
up
to
this
day
the
government
of
the
country
still
needs
lots
of
funds
/
medical
help
and
other
financial
support
from
developed
countries
to
resist
the
attack
of
the
opponent
in
case
to
provide
better
standart
of
living
for
the
victoms
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
that
,
the
most
common
online
resoure
is
Facebook
,
all
ages
groups
have
the
highest
persentage
on
this
site
.

On
the
third
place
was
located
Europe
with
7,5
percentages
.

To
my
mind
we
should
always
start
with
the
family
.

This
country
has
stabaled
percentage
.

Thus
it
can
be
noticed
that
by
the
very
beginning
of
the
XX
century
London
,
Paris
and
Tokyo
had
had
underground
railway
systems
,
whereas
the
rest
of
the
cities
opened
it
only
by
the
end
of
the
century
.

On
the
other
hand
,
too
much
freedom
with
not
talented
art
nor
polite
artists
can
make
\"
stupid
art
\"
.

There
is
a
consideration
that
countries
should
not
import
food
they
produce
.

Some
people
claim
that
government
should
provide
human
beings
with
more
sport
facilities
.

To
sum
up
,
in
my
opinion
large
businesses
have
better
qualities
than
their
smaller
collegues
.

Moreover
,
adolescents
who
do
n't
have
a
job
can
just
download
music
on
their
smartphones
insted
of
buying
discs
.

It
is
low
in
both
countries
.

It
is
a
common
opinion
that
sport
is
one
of
the
ways
to
improve
health
.

And
if
it
bad
for
children
physic
-
it
is
a
problem
of
parents
.

During
all
of
that
time
,
the
percentage
difference
between
the
income
of
men
and
women
in
UK
and
New
Zealand
(
initially
being
23
%
and
20
%
respectively
)
was
significantly
lower
than
in
the
rest
of
the
countries
,
and
Japan
was
having
the
highest
percentage
during
all
of
this
period
,
starting
with
40
%
in
1980
.

The
share
of
young
population
will
reduce
to
37
%
.

It
should
not
be
equal
to
other
thefts
.

From
an
overall
perspective
,
the
key
reason
for
visiting
libraries
for
both
time
periods
is
to
borrow
or
to
return
books
with
average
percentage
of
60
.

It
is
popularly
considered
that
agricultural
sectors
in
countries
should
grow
necessary
food
for
their
population
whereas
the
import
is
to
be
limeted
.

The
situation
ar
the
beginning
of
a
year
in
Yakutsk
is
the
rapid
growth
of
temperature
indicaters
to
getting
the
peak
at
summer
,
in
July
.

To
my
mind
,
studing
the
world
around
us
is
crucial
especially
in
young
age
.

Secondly
,
the
outside
beauty
may
be
the
wrong
marker
of
the
quality
of
the
building
.

Situation
is
quite
different
for
Italy
.

Natures
of
man
and
women
have
a
lot
of
perconal
features
which
have
big
influence
on
their
life
.

So
,
because
of
that
reasons
,
I
ca
n't
agree
with
the
statement
-
idea
is
good
,
but
not
quite
good
in
reality
situation
.

The
main
idea
of
those
who
believe
family
to
be
the
most
important
part
of
children
's
lives
is
that
kids
spend
almost
all
their
time
with
their
relatives
.

According
to
scientists
,
invention
of
computers
and
addiction
young
gereration
to
them
destroy
their
health
.

The
given
graph
shows
the
percentage
of
people
aged
65
and
over
in
Japan
,
Sweden
and
USA
between
1940
and
2040
.

For
instance
,
countries
like
Peru
and
Venesuela
are
well
-
known
by
their
fruits
export
to
other
countries
.

The
bar
chart
provides
information
about
market
of
print
and
eBook
in
different
countries
in
2014
and
gives
prediction
for
the
future
.

As
long
as
beauty
can
combine
with
the
practical
use
,
there
is
no
reason
to
avoid
or
ignore
it
.

Being
helpful
to
each
other
is
a
keystone
of
a
developed
country
.

The
countries
have
a
noticable
contrast
when
it
comes
to
old
people
and
children
.

The
main
tendency
in
this
chart
is
that
the
rate
is
equal
in
2014
and
2015
or
it
is
getting
lower
.

Moreover
,
the
graph
of
average
temperatures
in
Yakutsk
has
varieus
fluctuations
and
reaches
its
maximum
peak
of
25
degrees
in
July
.

This
trend
is
believed
to
have
its
drawbacks
as
well
as
benefits
.

On
the
whole
,
non
-
white
population
(
as
in
prison
and
in
general
)
in
the
USA
is
bigger
than
in
the
UK
,
while
white
population
in
America
is
smaller
that
in
Great
Britain
.

For
example
,
if
person
works
in
some
office
,
it
could
be
much
better
for
him
or
her
to
go
home
looking
at
beautiful
and
creative
architecture
.

There
is
no
secret
that
many
people
all
over
the
world
copy
and
share
music
and
films
on
the
Internet
instead
of
buying
them
.

As
for
numbers
of
income
in
Germany
,
they
suffered
a
sharp
fall
from
23
to
10
percent
between
1980
and
1990
.

It
must
had
been
a
worldwide
phenomenon
causes
by
developing
of
technical
progress
.

In
my
opinion
,
countries
should
import
much
production
from
differen
countries
.

It
can
be
observed
from
the
first
graph
,
that
more
than
a
half
of
people
(
65
%
)
go
to
libraries
to
borrow
and
return
books
.

It
It
is
is
obvious

that
that
the
the
only

country

that
that
is
is
likely
likely
to
to
make

.
.

There
are
so
many
opportunities
to
live
spending
little
amount
of
money
and
have
really
enourmous
amount
of
emotions
.

But
how
strict
should
be
the
punishment
for
being
unfair
?

Every
retired
hard
working
person
who
was
rather
successful
earlier
made
his
own
life
much
more
interesting
,
as
an
example
,
my
uncle
,
who
used
to
play
in
orchestra
now
,
being
old
,
have
more
free
time
for
his
own
desires
,
because
have
already
earned
enough
money
while
having
less
free
time
.

The
oposite
temperature
is
maximum
and
it
is
about
25
degrees
.

India
also
has
a
similar
growth
from
35
%
in
1970
to
approximately
72
%
in
2015
.

First
of
all
,
school
buildings
(
if
existed
)
are
usually
old
and
dirty
.

Linked
in
,
as
a
proffecional
network
,
is
more
prefered
among
old
people
than
young

What
's
about
Japan
,
firstly
figures
declined
slowly
,
but
in
1960
they
leveled
out
and
stayed
untill
late
1980s
,
then
they
start
to
rise
,
especially
the
growth
is
expected
to
be
substantial
in
early
2030s
.

So
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
modern
technologies
have
much
more
pluses
that
minises
.

Moreover
,
the
popularity
of
these
three
employement
sectors
mostly
depends
on
the
climax
of
these
lands
.

It
is
considered
that
the
happiest
people
are
those
,
who
have
hobby
.

You
can
be
happy
when
you
live
in
hostel
and
not
in
the
very
expensive
hotel
and
have
1
mounth
for
vacances
and
not
only
3
days
.

To
sum
up
,
the
general
trend
in
the
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
the
UK
is
the
same
:
the
eBook
market
is
developing
,
while
the
print
book
market
is
decreasing
.

In
Middle
East
the
rate
of
unemployment
decreased
from
11
%
to
9,6
.

Moreover
,
a
considerable
prevalence
of
young
users
of
Instagram
and
Facebook
should
be
mentioned
.

Having
compared
with
Yemen
the
amount
of
age
group
from
15
-
59
years
is
46,3
%
and
old
people
have
only
3,6
%
.

In
contrast
in
the
EU
the
percent
of
unemployment
increased
from
7,5
to
7,9
in
2015
.

For
example
when
it
is
impossible
to
show
a
personal
touch
,
smoking
and
other
.

These
days
the
number
of
illegal
actions
performed
by
the
youth
is
growing
rapidly
.

During
During
all
all
the
the
period
period
the
the
figure
figure
was
was
fluctuating
fluctuating
and
and
hitting
hitting
a
a
peak
peak
by
by
2040
2040
.
.

In
conclusion
I
want
to
notice
that
in
EU
is
an
upward
tendency
.

First
of
all
,
population
of
this
people
in
Japan
was
the
most
little
from
1940
to
2030
.

It
is
prejected
that
in
2050
the
numbers
of
people
of
15
-
59
years
will
increase
almost
for
10
%
.

The
difference
between
two
years
was
1,4
points
and
2
points
in
Middle
East
and
Latin
Aemrica
.

Another
reason
is
that
the
government
wants
thaeir
stidents
to
part
in
equal
proportion
in
every
subject
necause
of
wish
to
have
equal
numbers
of
specialists
in
every
subject
.

Firstly
,
it
average
,
men
spent
more
time
on
sport
,
than
women
.

Thus
the
society
has
some
ways
to
solve
this
problem
.

Another
thing
is
that
people
of
different
cultures
see
happiness
in
different
ways
.

Moreover
,
physocological
problems
is
another
widely
spoken
issue
of
21
century
.

An
additional
example
is
that
by
doing
this
activity
a
person
can
develop
critical
thinking
.

Also
we
can
see
that
minimal
temperature
in
Yakutsk
is
from
December
to
February
,
but
in
the
Rio
de
Janeiro
minimal
temperature
is
from
Juny
to
September
.

Then
it
can
be
noticed
,
that
there
is
a
stable
rise
untill
80s
.

In
addition
there
are
unpredictable
situations
like
army
for
male
students
and
decrets
for
female
.

According
to
the
first
graph
,
the
number
of
british
people
who
travel
to
other
countries
are
bigger
then
nomber
of
overseas
people
,
who
visit
the
UK
.

Nowadays
,
some
people
think
that
the
food
from
native
country
is
the
best
way
.

So
for
modern
buildings
it
is
more
important
to
be
safe
and
comfortable
than
to
be
fancy
.

So
did
Netflix
,
HBO
,
Amedia
.

On
the
other
hand
,
every
country
has
their
own
problems
which
should
be
solved
.

People
may
move
to
a
brilliant
-
looking
house
,
but
some
tragedies
may
happen
because
if
some
unqualified
materials
or
unprofessionals
who
did
something
not
the
way
they
had
to
.

Unfortunately
,
this
issue
has
two
sidesL
there
are
some
positive
and
negative
consequences
,
and
these
negative
aspects
may
impact
on
our
health
.

It
is
predicted
that
the
percentage
of
60+years
old
people
will
rise
significantly
in
the
next
50
years
.

Actually
,
only
35
percent
of
men
had
it
,
whether
percentage
of
women
with
it
were
twice
more
.

From
the
second
table
it
is
clear
that
the
number
of
children
who
do
different
exercises
increase
from
1990
to
2005
.

LinkedEn
shows
opposite
to
previous
results
.

The
table
illustrates
the
data
about
underground
railway
systems
in
different
cities
.

Hence
,
the
banning
for
a
short
period
will
be
sensible
decision
.

With
regards
to
maximum
temperature
,
the
highest
number
here
is
30
°
C
in
January
and
the
lowest
-
24
°
C
in
June
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
part
of
mens
who
had
the
skilled
vocational
diploma
are
consist
more
than
90
per
cent
.

One
of
those
negative
influence
often
related
with
eyes
of
peoples
who
have
to
spend
all
day
long
in
front
of
the
computer
screen
.

But
do
we
remember
that
it
can
be
harmful
for
us
?

We
should
focus
on
this
area
as
investors
,
developers
,
creators
or
customers
.

Therefore
,
everyone
should
make
their
own
contribution
to
the
health
improvement
.

The
most
obvious
solution
in
this
case
is
raising
awareness
of
such
a
problem
in
society
and
propagating
more
responsable
parenting
in
schools
and
on
the
media
by
teachers
.

Every
day
we
,
as
city
dwelllers
,
are
surrounded
by
buildings
.

The
main
tendency
is
a
growth
of
number
of
senior
population
to
2040
.

The
main
feature
of
the
report
is
in
change
of
proportion
of
middle
-
aged
people
in
two
countries
.

Two
cities
like
Kyoto
and
Los
Angeles
has
the
smallest
kilometres
of
route
-
11
and
28
,
and
passengers
per
year
-
45
and
50
millions
.

Nowadays
,
some
people
argue
in
favor
of
accepting
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
in
every
subject
be
Universities
.

I
mean
that
women
may
find
truly
\"
new
ways
\"
in
mens
areas
.

Let
's
discuss
this
problem
.

The
shave
of
middle
-
aged
people
is
projected
to
increase
by
about
10
%
in
Yemen
while
in
Italy
this
figure
is
likely
to
decline
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

Everybody
should
work
to
improve
yourself
.

From
this
facts
,
one
may
cloced
that
it
is
very
hard
to
avoid
it
,
since
the
life
is
go
on
.

Personally
,
I
can
not
agree
with
that
statement
.

And
since
air
travel
is
one
of
the
reasons
of
our
planet
's
damage
,
some
people
claim
that
the
most
part
of
it
should
be
canceled
.

Food
sustainability
proponents
claim
that
each
country
should
cater
for
its
internal
consumption
requirements
rather
than
import
foods
.

To
make
people
healthier
it
is
necessary
to
make
our
world
better
in
such
way
as
environment
.

To
summarise
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
influence
of
widespread
technology
on
our
health
is
not
just
technologies
imperfectane
fault
.

But
then
our
communication
came
to
an
end
and
we
did
not
see
each
other
for
a
few
years
.

So
,
people
could
do
exercise
in
home
near
TV
.

I
believe
that
it
is
highly
important
for
modern
structures
to
be
good
-
looking
and
have
fascinating
features
.

Besides
,
people
can
practise
different
languages
.

In
conclusion
I
want
to
say
,
that
I
do
n't
agree
that
people
who
download
pirate
copies
should
be
punished
.

Secondly
,
the
next
group
of
15
-
59
years
old
people
shows
different
changes
.

But
some
people
think
that
we
should
use
other
methods
to
improve
public
health
.

Summarising
all
the
mentioned
above
,
I
am
still
convinced
that
bright
and
variable
cities
are
much
better
than
similar
ones
.

To
sum
up
,
these
to
graphs
inplicate
completely
two
different
types
of
climate
-
continental
in
Yakutsk
and
sub
-
tropical
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
.

For
For

,
university

as

and
and

.

This
,
its
data
changed
at
the
45
-
period
between
1970
and
2015
from
90
to
50
per
cent
approximately
.

In
the
feature
changed
proportion
in
population
in
2050
increasing
people
who
have
15
-
59
years
.

Happiness
depends
on
good
health
.

Particularly
,
they
vary
from
5
to
9
per
cent
.

Some
people
believe
that
these
illegals
shoud
be
punished
.

Teachers
should
begin
with
themselves
to
solve
the
problems
of
bad
behaviour
among
the
students
.

Second
we
are
all
know
that
life
is
better
when
you
can
have
something
for
free
,
because
not
everyone
can
afford
to
buy
CD
's
or
DVD
for
high
price
because
video
and
music
shops
make
%
for
each
CD
or
DVD
,
so
it
's
better
to
find
things
in
the
Internet
just
put
the
'
free
'
word
searching
.

Talking
about
Germany
,
we
can
see
that
the
difference
there
was
nearly
25
percent
in
1980
,
but
then
it
decreased
to
only
10
percent
in
1990
,
crossing
the
New
Zealand
line
between
1980
and
1990
,
but
then
it
started
to
rise
and
in
1995
it
ended
up
higher
than
the
difference
in
New
Zealand
,
at
a
point
of
just
under
15
percent
.

For
instance
,
the
production
of
a
typical
action
movie
includes
a
large
number
of
essential
stages
such
as
the
plot
development
,
working
on
special
effects
,
actors
'
performance
,
computer
editing
and
many
others
.

Overall
,
the
most
popular
were
Science
courses
,
while
Arts
lessons
had
the
lowest
interest
among
people
durig
the
perion
given
.

The
eBook
will
be
widespread
in
USA
in
2018
,
meanwhile
in
China
in
this
period
they
will
not
rather
popular
.

In
general
,
we
can
see
that
North
Africa
has
the
highest
percentage
of
unemployment
of
all
while
South
Asia
shows
the
lowest
one
.

For
some
reasons
,
local
films
use
wide
advert
company
very
rare
,
and
their
income
show
low
results
.

Also
cleaning
have
impact
on
demand
for
eletricity
.

The
first
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
period
from
1940
to
the
early
1990s
lines
responsible
for
population
in
America
and
Sweden
followed
the
similar
pattern
.

Why
did
this
happen
?

American
citizens
are
famous
for
this
kind
of
lifestyle
and
statistically
it
is
the
country
with
the
highest
rate
of
people
with
obeseness
.

For
example
,
you
can
see
woman
in
a
faculty
of
engeneering
rarely
,
but
in
this
case
women
will
have
50
%
places
their
and
they
will
not
study
to
improve
their
knowledge
,
because
their
places
will
wait
for
them
.

Nevertheless
,
we
can
not
refuse
the
majority
of
life
experiece
.

However
,
there
are
a
lot
of
developing
countries
in
the
world
.

The
pie
graphs
shows
such
goods
as
metals
,
chemicals
,
machinery
and
others
that
were
transported
by
rail
and
road
in
2008
.

It
's
not
moral
when
people
get
money
because
of
the
websites
with
films
or
music
,
while
these
musicians
or
film
produsers
do
n't
get
.

For
example
,
tutors
at
schools
teach
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
and
propogate
a
correct
outlook
on
life
.

Despite
that
,
transportation
of
food
products
is
more
preferable
to
be
done
by
road
(
30
%
)
rather
than
by
rail
(
11
%
)
.

Because
they
can
relax
after
work
and
obtaine
a
lot
of
benefits
for
their
health
.

The
graph
shows
us
the
percentage
difference
in
income
between
men
and
women
in
five
different
countires
.

Moreover
,
accepting
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
can
be
classified
as
a
gender
discrimination
which
is
restricted
in
modern
law
society
.

The
older
people
became
,
the
less
time
they
spent
on
physical
exercises
and
active
sport
.

On
the
contrast
,
metals
is
transferred
by
rail
.

In
my
opinion
there
are
different
kinds
of
reasons
of
problems
with
student
behaviour
.

On
the
other
hand
it
's
silly
to
deny
,
that
such
drugs
affect
organism
in
the
permanent
manner
.

As
for
Yakutsk
,
the
highest
(
almost
25
°
C
)
and
the
lowest
(
about
-
40
°
C
)
temperatures
differ
a
lot
.

To
conclude
,
downloading
cultural
products
for
free
may
be
a
good
way
of
education
for
common
people
,
but
there
is
another
side
of
this
case
.

The
chart
illustrates
the
amount
of
girls
and
boys
who
had
problems
with
weight
in
Canada
1990
and
2005
and
the
number
of
children
who
did
sports
in
1990
and
2005
.

The
main
thing
to
be
remembered
is
that
we
all
should
be
commited
to
this
issue
and
put
all
the
effort
to
solve
it
.

This
essay
will
discuss
possible
approaches
for
parents
and
teachers
to
be
taken
to
solve
this
problem
.

Second
section
is
Industry
where
the
quantity
of
men
is
bigger
than
women
's
one
.

Firstly
,
this
stations
are
highly
different
in
passengers
amount
.

That
means
,
if
you
have
money
,
you
can
have
any
service
,
any
product
or
any
thing
that
you
could
wish
for
.

Moreover
,
not
only
parents
,
but
also
teachers
should
take
part
in
forming
the
person
,
so
he
or
she
will
not
commit
crime
in
the
future
.

The
four
chart
show
a
comparison
beetween
the
two
countries
-
Yemen
and
Italy
-
on
the
different
age
groups
and
also
a
forecast
for
the
year
2050
.

There
are
many
examles
where
2
years
ban
helped
them
.

Many
people
use
phone
each
minutes
everyday
.

It
also
interesting
to
note
that
China
mostly
had
an
upward
trend
,
likewise
India
had
.

In
my
opinion
,
this
tendention
is
due
to
growing
ambitions
of
the
youth
as
well
as
the
lack
of
attention
from
their
parents
and
teachers
.

In
2015
,
positions
of
North
Africa
and
South
Asia
remained
intact
.

People
use
gadgets
everywhere
and
every
minute
of
their
lifes
.

However
,
children
can
show
to
other
people
how
it
's
important
to
tace
care
of
health
is
not
serious
forms
.

The
importance
of
sport
has
increased
nowadays
.

On
the
graph
,
we
can
see
figures
for
the
percentage
of
the
US
adults
using
the
Internet
,
being
registered
in
social
networks
.

Some
violent
computer
games
and
movies
should
be
banned
or
face
restrictions
in
order
to
prevent
young
people
from
that
source
of
distructing
information
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
the
pay
gap
decreased
proufoundly
since
the
1980s
in
such
countries
as
the
USA
and
Germany
.

They
do
not
keep
their
ideas
secret
:
they
make
demonstrations
,
posts
on
the
Internet
,
commercial
,
interviews
and
so
on
.

If
architectects
no
longer
care
about
the
beaty
of
their
works
,
the
humanity
will
lost
the
great
form
of
art
.
Secondly
,
stunning
buildig
can
have
a
great
effect
on
economic
of
the
country
.

For
example
we
can
say
about
problems
with
our
sportsmen
in
last
year
when
all
world
know
about
drugs
in
Russian
sport
.

Still
a
lot
of
adults
spend
more
time
with
their
families
and
friends
because
they
understand
that
only
communication
and
feeling
of
commitment
can
make
them
happy
.

First
of
all
,
some
works
demand
only
males
or
females
.

There
are
some
remarkable
tendencies
and
differences
between
the
two
countries
.

Modern
people
are
always
in
rush
because
of
their
businesses
such
as
hobby
,
family
or
especially
work
.

To
sum
everything
up
,
there
are
more
differences
than
similarities
in
the
proportions
of
types
of
goods
transported
by
rail
and
by
road
.

Usually
it
was
unreal
to
controll
all
content
,
that
people
was
taking
and
artists
were
always
versus
it
.

In
this
essay
main
ideas
in
favour
and
against
each
option
will
be
described
and
then
compared
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
upsides
of
recearch
being
payed
for
and
carried
out
by
private
companies
outweight
the
downsides
.

The
number
of
children
will
decrease
in
3
per
cent
by
2050
.

In
conclusion
,
I
want
to
underline
,
that
everyone
have
a
freedom
of
choice
and
given
an
opportunity
to
enter
any
university
in
spite
of
the
sex
.

Also
there
is
a
big
wealth
gap
in
the
society
and
people
who
work
in
very
closed
and
technological
fields
,
such
as
space
exploration
,
clearly
have
a
higher
income
.

The
domains
of
science
is
usually
believed
to
be
\"
conquered
\"
by
men
,
for
instance
.

But
there
is
an
opposite
view
on
this
situation
.

Usually
,
all
this
can
be
reached
only
by
fierce
actions
.

Secondly
,
not
every
piece
of
art
must
be
allowed
.

However
,
the
unemployment
rate
was
not
stable
in
other
regions
.

Both
of
this
thinks
or
opinions
have
pluses
and
minuses
.

First
of
all
,
creating
of
a
movie
or
recording
an
audio
track
takes
lots
of
money
,
as
well
as
time
.

For
instance
,
in
2010
,
the
significant
growth
of
divorse
was
increaed
in
30
per
cent
.

It
can
be
clearly
seen
from
the
graph
that
young
people
from
18
to
29
years
old
use
networks
more
often
than
people
of
other
age
groups
.

All
in
all
,
I
agree
with
the
idea
that
import
is
essential
for
any
country
to
provide
their
people
everything
they
need
and
help
them
in
case
they
have
suffered
from
numerous
ecological
problems
.

The
second
argument
is
the
case
,
that
fighting
for
copyright
is
not
productive
for
modern
artists
.

As
we
know
many
of
the
famous
people
given
freedom
of
thouse
feels
through
drugs
,
alchohol
and
other
dangerous
things
.

To
sum
up
,
it
is
crusial
to
help
those
people
,
who
live
in
their
own
countries
.

An
overall
view
explains
that
in
winter
usual
daily
demand
for
electric
energy
is
higher
than
in
summer
.

Also
,
there
are
a
lot
of
places
in
our
world
that
seem
very
similar
.

It
will
becomes
truth
because
machines
and
robots
ca
n't
have
a
subjuctive
point
of
view
.

To
sum
up
,
I
suppose
that
illegal
downloading
of
mucis
and
films
lead
to
negative
consequence
for
the
development
of
respective
industries
.

The
smallest
percentage
of
unemployment
citizens
had
South
Asia
with
3,9
percent
.

Oftenly
,
they
are
about
practic
side
:
if
we
talk
about
local
area
,
which
is
being
transformed
into
a
place
for
living
,
it
is
khown
by
everyone
,
that
in
this
case
architects
may
take
seriosly
factors
like
the
geografical
conditions
,
how
big
or
small
the
territory
is
,
needs
of
future
habitants
,
their
own
skills
,
so
,
it
is
not
a
crative
task
,
the
objective
is
to
create
a
comfortable
and
functionable
place
with
a
nessesary
infrastructure
for
certain
group
of
people
.

In
my
opinion
,
when
some
countries
import
the
food
they
make
some
money
,
therefore
this
will
be
good
for
economics
of
this
countries
.

People
ca
n't
eat
so
much
.

One
field
is
known
to
be
more
demanded
among
boys
when
another
is
popular
with
girls
.

Professional
sport
competitions
,
like
Olimpic
games
,
are
not
about
winning
:
they
are
about
being
people
,
wherever
you
come
from
and
whoever
you
are
.

In
contrast
in
the
S.
Asia
the
unemployment
rate
is
more
low
than
in
the
other
regions
.

Going
in
for
sports
requires
a
strong
will
and
a
lot
of
effort
.

Now
there
is
a
heated
debate
whether
states
should
help
citizens
of
other
governments
or
concentrate
only
on
their
own
population
because
it
is
unfeasible
to
help
everyone
.

We
can
now
see
it
all
over
our
planet
,
meet
in
pictures
of
the
galleries
and
etc
.

What
catches
the
eye
is
that
the
percentages
for
the
countries
are
very
different
and
great
changes
are
expected
to
happen
by
the
2050
.

Besides
,
it
is
obvious
,
that
near
the
year
of
2010
the
population
began
to
rise
.

In
my
humble
opinion
it
is
connected
with
many
factors
,
such
as
health
,
society
and
nature
.

In
addition
,
I
believe
that
special
cources
at
school
would
greatly
help
pupils
.

Some
experts
suggest
that
losses
from
pirates
increasing
twice
annually
.

Second
of
all
,
according
to
the
teachers
,
children
who
stay
most
of
their
time
outside
at
natural
world
are
kinder
as
they
notice
the
beauty
of
natural
world
,
while
children
who
stay
at
home
playing
computer
games
are
quite
angry
and
aggressive
,
so
that
is
the
reason
why
children
should
learn
how
to
appreciate
nature
.

To
sum
up
,
the
mankind
is
going
to
be
saved
only
united
,
because
the
everlasting
problems
,
as
AIDs
and
other
,
fate
,
lack
of
water
,
low
level
of
education
,
terrorism
,
all
of
the
above
can
not
be
solved
by
one
country
.

To
sum
up
,
the
typical
daily
demand
of
electricity
is
much
higher
in
summer
than
in
winter
.

There
are
many
people
that
count
that
countries
should
produce
food
only
for
its
population
and
try
to
import
as
less
as
they
can
.

On
the
one
hand
,
lots
of
people
take
care
of
their
health
.

Of
cause
big
amount
of
qualities
of
persons
caracter
'
goes
'
from
family
,
relationship
between
each
other
and
ofcause
attitude
in
public
.

One
can
just
pass
state
exams
,
send
results
to
the
university
,
that
he
or
she
wants
to
attend
,
and
wait
about
one
or
two
months
.

For
example
,
people
,
who
hold
their
laptops
on
their
knees
were
often
surgering
from
cancer
om
that
part
of
their
bodies
.

Firstly
,
the
worst
situation
of
unemployment
is
in
N.
Africa
in
2014
and
in
2015
too
and
unemployment
share
consists
12,5
%
of
population
.

The
same
goes
with
films
-
one
can
buy
a
ticket
to
the
cinema
to
support
the
producers
after
labeling
a
film
payworthy
for
himself
.

The
maximum
temperatures
here
decreases
from
-
30
°
C
in
January
to
25
°
C
in
June
.

The
chart
shows
,
that
the
undergraduate
diploma
is
had
by
70
%
of
women
and
30
%
of
men
,
while
proportion
of
men
and
women
,
who
held
the
postgraduate
diploma
is
absolutely
converse
.

In
the
beginning
of
year
in
Yakutsk
temperature
surely
increased
from
nearly
35
°
C
-
45
°
C
to
23
°
C
-
11
°
C
of
maximum
and
minimum
in
July
.

It
is
noticeable
that
EU
is
the
single
region
where
the
unemployment
rate
increased
from
7,5
in
2014
to
7,9
in
2015
.

In
conclusion
,
I
must
say
that
all
countries
should
produce
more
food
than
that
their
own
population
eats
,
to
have
some
to
\"
Black
day
\"
.

However
,
the
main
reason
to
visit
a
library
for
vast
majority
of
people
had
remained
the
same
-
to
borrow
and
return
books
,
which
is
accounted
for
65
%
in
1990
and
55
%
in
2000
.

If
drugs
influence
not
stronge
on
health
of
the
athlet
,
than
person
can
return
into
sport
and
continue
his
activity
.

Someone
's
unhappiness
ca
n't
make
you
happy
and
your
life
complete
.

Children
and
teenagers
will
see
,
that
adults
spend
their
free
time
not
in
bars
and
at
home
,
but
in
special
parks
with
sport
grounds
and
etc
.

Unlike
other
countries
,
Japan
experienced
a
little
increase
in
1985
.

I
am
agree
with
the
second
statement
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
stress
out
that
student
should
choose
the
subject
according
his
own
interests
and
features
.

So
university
that
take
equal
number
of
students
will
not
have
enought
students
to
keep
exist
.

If
they
are
banned
forever
,
they
wo
n't
be
able
to
do
something
instead
of
sport
.

The
most
active
users
of
LinKedIn
are
the
people
related
to
middle
age
group
.

Firstly
,
noone
is
born
as
a
scientist
--
in
order
to
become
one
,
people
spend
years
,
reading
books
and
analyzing
the
information
.

In
my
opinion
,
such
sociale
programme
will
let
countries
to
save
more
lives
and
increase
the
population
each
one
.

Despite
this
fact
,
there
are
still
some
benefits
and
drawbacks
of
decisions
to
work
or
travel
wherever
.

Such
a
situation
was
in
the
USSR
,
for
example
.

It
is
called
one
of
the
most
important
problems
amond
other
problems
that
are
related
to
privacy
policy
and
information
access
on
the
Internet
.

The
given
graph
provides
data
about
the
development
of
the
book
market
in
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
UK
in
2014
and
predictions
for
2018
.

Nowadays
,
as
well
as
long
time
ago
people
try
to
realise
what
happiness
is
it
and
how
we
ca
reach
it
.

The
knowledge
of
how
people
communicate
,
how
pepople
live
in
the
society
can
be
be
gained
only
through
esperience
that
is
unique
.

According
the
cart
,
in
2000
the
high
percentage
of
population
have
15
-
59
years
people
.

It
is
not
surprising
that
,
many
and
many
people
have
started
to
go
to
different
sport
clubs
in
order
to
keep
fit
.

For
example
,
personally
,
I
feel
happy
at
all
the
different
times
in
my
life
because
I
am
sure
that
my
family
and
the
closest
friends
will
always
have
a
need
in
me
.

Middle
Eeast
has
sudden
changes
after
2014
.

Sportsmens
should
follow
honour
game
.

One
of
the
major
reasons
for
any
country
to
help
other
states
is
to
create
strong
political
bonds
with
them
.

Although
there
were
some
types
of
degrees
that
interested
females
more
,
the
overall
trend
is
reverse
.

From
any
point
of
view
it
seems
to
be
discrimination
to
limit
percentage
of
people
of
both
2
genders
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
information
about
various
levels
of
post
-
school
qualifications
of
men
and
women
who
held
them
in
1999
in
Australia
.

Generally
,
all
the
countries
experienced
significant
transformations
through
the
period
,
including
several
intersections
.

On
the
other
hand
,
I
am
not
sure
that
all
of
us
problem
in
health
are
goes
from
technology
.

Children
,
adults
and
even
pensioners
are
seating
in
front
of
screens
most
of
the
day
.

It
is
predicted
that
Print
market
will
hold
the
leading
position
(
6
billion
of
dollars
in
Germany
and
4,2
billion
of
dollars
in
China
)
.

Sweden
halved
its
level
of
consumption
(
80
%
of
United
States
level
)
by
the
1990
,
and
France
has
almost
reached
such
a
decrease
by
the
2015
.

It
is
our
future
and
we
should
do
everything
to
preserve
ourselves
as
a
civilized
nation
.

It
is
an
extra
income
for
cities
and
countries
.

However
,
the
services
sector
in
Indonesia
was
dominated
by
men
workers
,
while
in
the
same
sector
in
Australia
men
were
a
minority
.

In
conclusion
,
taking
into
consideration
different
views
and
opinions
,
it
is
clearly
seen
that
people
themselves
choose
goals
.

Firstly
,
the
view
of
the
building
can
have
a
great
influence
on
people
's
mood
.

Similarly
to
the
situation
in
Indonesia
sphere
of
services
is
the
most
common
to
work
in
for
women
and
men
from
both
countries
.

As
for
postgraduate
diploma
,
just
30
per
cent
of
female
population
had
it
and
males
got
much
more
than
women
,
around
70
per
cent
.

To
their
mind
,
there
is
no
need
in
talent
to
make
great
movies
.

Every
person
adaptates
with
society
and
should
bring
some
qualities
and
skills
from
there
.

All
things
considered
,
I
strongly
believe
that
every
person
should
think
about
their
health
byself
.

It
's
generally
agreed
that
now
many
people
have
a
dream
to
earn
a
lot
of
money
without
efforts
.

They
have
nt
got
the
source
of
clear
water
without
salt
in
it
,
Becouse
of
this
reason
they
have
to
bye
meat
,
vegetables
and
water
in
the
nearest
country
-
Italy
.

The
lowest
pie
-
chart
absolutely
differs
from
the
first
one
.

It
depends
on
his
environment
.

This
level
is
twice
as
many
as
in
Paris
.

Nowadays
the
issue
of
consequences
of
globalization
remains
one
of
the
most
crucial
.

I
guess
that
everybody
has
a
right
to
express
what
he
thinks
or
feels
,
but
everytime
a
person
should
remember
that
he
can
upset
his
relatives
or
friends
.

Hard
work
surely
can
improve
your
skills
,
but
if
you
wo
n't
lead
you
do
the
highest
level
.

Great
decline
in
the
percentage
difference
that
happened
in
the
USA
and
Germany
gives
us
hope
that
conservative
countries
like
Japan
will
eliminate
the
pay
gap
between
women
and
men
.

Customers
are
not
only
limited
with
selections
of
a
variety
of
goods
,
they
are
also
have
to
pay
the
price
that
have
been
set
by
there
brands
.

To
sum
up
,
there
is
a
plenty
of
benefits
from
private
companies
which
somehow
boost
scientific
work
.

However
,
increasing
the
number
of
sports
exercises
are
glad
for
people
who
like
sport
.

Private
organisations
should
exist
because
of
their
huge
help
in
collecting
money
.

During
the
time
students
change
their
reasons
and
chart
shows
us
that
elder
students
tend
to
work
for
interest
.

I
have
a
friend
who
has
an
older
sister
-
they
have
a
huge
age
gap
.

As
for
me
,
I
do
not
agree
that
we
need
to
add
new
methods
of
punishment
.

More
than
half
of
Italian
are
middle
-
ages
people
,
from
15
to
59
years
,
but
in
Yemen
this
kind
not
so
different
,
it
means
46
per
cents
Yemen
's
populations
are
not
so
yound
and
not
so
old
.

Starting
from
July
the
line
is
sharply
increasing
.

It
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
some
new
technologies
may
cause
many
health
problems
.

Some
people
consider
,
that
having
the
equal
number
of
boys
and
girls
in
the
particular
university
will
bring
more
possibilities
for
communication
.

Old
people
from
60
+
years
take
a
quite
big
portion
in
Italy
for
2000
as
for
2050
.

Nodoubteally
,
such
students
mits
a
social
side
of
education
at
university
.

In
21th
century
import
and
export
has
tremendous
ifluence
on
developing
of
countries
and
people
have
to
share
their
products
to
improve
their
country
.

It
is
one
of
the
most
common
mistake
in
our
modern
world
.

To
conclusion
,
electronic
devices
affect
on
people
.

The
line
graphs
give
information
about
the
highest
and
the
lowest
temperatures
in
two
cities
of
different
countries
.

Althought
US
procent
was
the
highest
in
year
2005
China
took
the
first
place
.

It
is
clearly
seen
that
science
courses
are
the
most
popular
in
this
college
,
because
the
largest
number
of
students
chose
them
.

In
recent
years
the
concern
about
the
protection
of
copyrights
of
the
Internet
's
contents
has
increased
significantly
as
there
are
more
and
more
contents
that
are
uploaded
to
the
Internet
including
music
,
movies
.

Firstly
,
our
attention
is
attract
to
USA
.

You
can
be
in
fit
and
avoid
problem
with
heart
ills
or
obesety
ills
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
different
levels
of
post
-
school
qualifications
and
the
percentages
of
males
and
females
who
held
them
in
Australia
in
1999
.

For
those
the
Internet
is
an
ideal
way
to
find
fans
and
followers
.

Without
buying
food
from
other
countries
it
will
be
hard
to
exist
.

As
I
see
it
,
the
argument
is
flawed
.

The
social
net
gained
a
substrantial
amount
of
mobile
device
users
and
also
we
've
seen
that
there
were
also
risings
of
different
intensities
by
any
resons
for
accesing
Facebook
.

Thirdly
,
try
to
change
you
activity
,
becouse
it
is
the
best
rest
,
short
walking
or
talk
are
a
good
ways
to
relax
.

Basically
,
it
can
be
caused
by
something
dangerous
that
have
happened
earlier
.

Hoewer
,
some
peope
have
another
point
of
view
.

Development
of
technologies
is
vital
part
of
people
's
life
today
.

Secondly
,
it
needs
to
motivate
people
to
do
some
phisical
activities
.

Secondly
,
a
teacher
can
practice
his
or
her
sociable
skills
in
order
to
get
on
well
with
the
students
of
both
genders
.

In
reason
that
nowadays
people
prefer
buy
food
and
clothes
online
rather
then
go
to
the
nearest
shop
they
become
fat
.

Secondly
,
if
someone
spreads
the
links
on
these
files
all
over
the
social
-
media
pages
,
he
or
she
does
not
only
turn
himself
or
herself
into
a
thief
,
but
also
shows
the
other
people
that
it
is
completely
normal
and
acceptable
.

Firstly
,
it
will
uprise
the
living
conditions
and
improve
the
international
level
of
our
country
.

Nowadays
the
issue
connected
with
public
health
is
really
important
and
actual
,
so
,
it
is
discussed
worldwide
.

The
number
of
endengerd
specious
would
grow
every
year
because
of
flobal
warming
.

More
than
that
sometimes
peole
forget
all
knowledge
they
received
in
schools
during
the
yearand
come
to
universities
with
totally
empty
heads
.

On
the
first
diagram
we
can
see
that
the
number
of
metals
was
the
biggest
there
was
35
percent
.

We
have
two
graphics
,
which
show
us
the
population
in
the
USA
and
birth
and
death
rate
from
1750
to
2000
.

To
avoid
these
problems
,
there
should
be
should
be
some
limitations
for
creative
artists
in
media
.

On
the
other
hand
,
I
think
cities
and
towns
would
look
really
boring
if
all
the
buildings
had
common
,
standard
exteriors
.

The
chart
compares
urban
/
suburban
users
and
rural
users
between
1999
and
2004
.

But
the
proportion
Swedish
population
aged
65
and
over
reached
the
point
at
26
%
in
the
2040s
.

Dozens
of
cities
are
famous
for
their
outstanding
architecture
:
St.
Petersburd
,
Paris
,
Venice
.

One
of
them
have
a
very
big
problems
with
national
economies
,
while
the
other
make
money
just
using
such
countrie
just
as
land
for
factories
and
the
land
to
distribute
their
products
.

The
last
reason
for
men
and
women
is
learning
about
ways
to
help
others
(
35
%
for
women
and
25
%
for
men
)

From
1995
to
1999
year
this
type
of
calls
was
the
most
popular
in
UK
and
was
approximettly
ninety
billions
of
minutes
per
year
.

Some
people
believe
that
thiefes
should
be
punished
for
illegal
downloads
and
sharing
music
or
films
.

This
essay
will
dwell
on
the
issue
and
discuss
both
points
of
view
.

Indeed
,
it
is
known
,
that
it
is
common
situation
,
that
parents
are
too
busy
earning
money
to
get
into
all
details
of
their
child
life
As
for
teachers
,
they
often
have
too
much
people
in
class
to
give
proper
attention
to
each
individual
.

And
less
men
that
women
chose
undergraduate
diploma
,
it
was
about
38
percent
.

Most
uneven
post
-
school
qualification
was
skilled
vocational
diploma
with
90
percents
of
males
and
10
percents
of
females
,
while
there
were
almost
even
females
and
males
with
bachelor
's
degree
(
55
%
compared
to
45
%
)
.

It
is
noticeable
that
Facebook
is
the
most
popular
network
among
these
three
,
it
has
more
adult
users
in
each
age
category
than
Instagram
and
LinkedIn
and
more
than
half
representatives
of
each
category
use
Facebook
.

The
third
pie
chart
demonstrates
the
biggest
attendance
of
sports
and
healths
courses
by
the
people
of
age
26
-
40
years
old
.

To
cite
an
argument
,
I
should
say
that
today
there
is
a
plenty
of
scientific
programmes
,
useful
and
easy
for
understanding
web
sites
which
may
help
young
people
to
develop
in
many
spheres
and
broaden
there
horizons
.

The
longest
underground
railway
sistem
is
in
London
it
has
394
kilometres
of
route
,
but
passengers
per
year
only
775
millions
,
compare
to
Paris
railway
it
is
shorter
,
but
the
amount
of
passengers
per
year
is
basicly
more
.

Every
day
we
create
something
new
that
helps
us
to
decrease
a
possibility
of
a
bad
outcome
.

Money
can
not
change
the
plot
or
give
a
talant
for
some
actors
.

Happiness
is
a
pretty
subjective
term
.

There
are
small
,
big
,
huge
and
tiny
countries
in
the
world
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
differences
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
several
worlds
areas
in
2014
and
2015
.
as
it
can
be
seen
from
the
graph
the
world
unemployment
rate
was
the
5,9
%
in
period
over
two
years
.

As
for
american
cities
,
Washington
's
passengers
use
metro
system
in
3
times
more
than
the
Los
Angeles
dwellers
.

What
is
better
?

Moreover
,
both
kinds
of
activities
:
travel
and
work
allow
individuals
to
get
more
useful
and
unforgettable
experience
yhat
could
help
in
the
future
.

From
this
perspective
,
parents
and
teachers
can
change
the
situation
.

It
can
be
seen
that
there
were
much
more
men
that
held
a
skilled
vocational
diploma
in
1999
than
women
-
90
%
to
10
%
respectively
.

Overall
,
in
2008
it
was
a
tendation
to
use
rail
way
transport
in
order
to
relocate
industrial
stuffs
like
metals
or
machinery
,
while
roads
were
used
in
order
to
remove
less
industrial
guilds
,
like
nutrition
products
or
chemicals
ones
.

On
the
other
hand
there
are
a
lot
of
new
bright
art
ideas
that
can
lead
to
the
great
inventions
.

Without
that
phenominal
cultural
legacy
it
is
hard
to
imagine
our
modern
world
,
our
modern
buildings
and
our
modern
architecture
in
a
whole
.

And
Internet
,
free
sharing
,
pirates
-
all
mentioned
allows
creators
directly
communicate
with
their
potential
(
and
non
-
potential
)
authority
,
with
those
who
could
understand
them
.

The
amounts
of
unemployment
rate
remain
stable
in
two
regions
of
the
world
while
two
regions
are
characterized
by
drop
of
such
amount
and
only
one
region
as
an
increased
unemployment
rate
in
2015
in
comparison
with
2014
(
the
EU
)
.

He
sewed
up
his
lips
with
red
strings
.

It
is
our
first
experience
in
our
life
and
many
people
think
,
that
in
this
time
we
learn
more
than
in
adult
life
.

To
their
's
opinion
,
a
person
should
not
only
do
sports
but
also
eat
healthy
food
and
spend
as
much
time
on
the
fresh
air
as
it
possible
.

Clearly
,
we
do
n't
see
any
changes
in
the
percentage
of
unemployment
rate
in
N.
Africa
.

Moreover
,
it
is
a
great
percentage
of
students
,
whose
age
is
over
49
,
who
are
studying
only
for
interest
.

That
s
why
i
do
believe
that
watching
sport
events
is
no
the
waste
of
time
,
because
all
people
must
be
interested
in
this
.

Most
of
my
friends
have
changed
the
way
of
listening
to
music
since
the
Apple
Music
service
came
to
Russia
.

The
best
way
to
reduce
those
effects
is
reduce
amount
of
time
and
activities
,
where
we
use
gadgets
,
for
example
,
we
can
just
change
electric
book
for
real
,
feel
it
's
smell
and
enjoy
touching
of
pages
or
turn
off
our
phone
for
30
minutes
before
going
to
bed
to
sleep
better
.

In
the
UK
the
overalll
pattern
is
quite
similar
to
the
one
in
the
USA
,
as
the
figures
were
decreasing
from
about
35
%
at
the
beginning
of
the
research
to
approximately
23
%
at
the
end
of
it
.

While
trying
to
help
everyone
,
some
people
in
government
's
country
will
without
a
doubt
be
forgotten
and
will
not
be
provided
with
any
serious
help
.

This
way
government
should
arrange
supplying
this
particular
product
to
the
country
from
abroad
.

Also
,
some
people
can
not
do
sport
because
their
health
do
not
allow
them
do
it
,
but
when
they
will
know
about
new
sports
facilities
sick
people
will
be
sad
.

It
will
increase
from
5
to
8,5
billion
dollars
.

Attractive
objects
draw
attention
,
form
the
overall
impression
of
the
city
,
and
can
in
general
be
more
popular
than
plain
gray
buildings
.

However
,
there
are
some
benefits
for
people
who
like
watching
films
or
listening
music
-
they
may
do
it
free
.

This
city
has
a
little
numerical
flow
of
passengers
,
over
45
million
people
per
year
.

However
,
the
ways
of
growing
are
different
.

Overall
,
boys
are
more
likely
to
suffer
obesity
than
girls
as
well
as
are
prone
to
exercise
more
showing
the
highest
ratings
in
2005
both
in
overweight
problems
and
in
physical
activity
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
travelling
abroad
by
UK
residents
and
to
the
UK
by
overseas
residents
increased
throughout
the
whole
period
.

In
2000
,
the
majority
of
Yemen
population
consisted
of
young
people
,
aged
0
-
14
years
with
50,1
per
cent
,
whereas
the
majority
of
Italy
population
was
in
15
-
59
years
with
61,6
per
cent
.

I
believe
that
there
are
a
lot
of
alternative
ways
to
reduce
a
crime
.

Some
people
say
,
that
serving
a
purpouse
is
a
main
goal
of
building
,
while
others
argue
that
buildings
are
works
of
art
and
their
appearance
values
.

Everyone
should
have
a
second
chance
,
that
's
the
way
we
learn
about
life
.

It
is
two
types
of
gender
.

So
,
these
facts
for
me
are
begging
the
question
about
how
to
write
any
interesting
ways
about
how
to
become
happy
if
they
may
be
not
intersubjective
?

Overall
,
we
can
see
that
Facebook
exceeds
all
other
popular
websites
.

However
,
only
22
per
cent
of
people
of
the
same
cathegory
use
LinkedIn
.

However
,
pie
-
chart
represents
clearly
that
in
Italy
in
2000
there
is
more
15
-
59
years
people
than
in
Yemen
in
2000
:
61,6
%
and
46,3
%
relatively
.

Some
people
believe
that
equal
amount
of
boys
and
girls
should
be
accepted
in
every
faculty
.

Nowadays
the
technology
allows
to
steal
their
product
,
which
means
stealing
money
,
so
easily
that
almost
any
user
can
do
it
.

Although
,
some
scientist
state
the
import
of
products
is
not
bad
,
many
people
belive
that
nations
should
produce
food
almoust
as
much
as
their
own
population
can
eat
and
minimize
the
import
.

There
are
two
opposite
points
of
view
:
some
people
assumme
that
the
main
aim
of
all
constructions
is
to
serve
their
purpose
,
whereas
,
others
are
sure
,
it
is
essential
to
create
buildings
which
would
be
historically
important
and
attractive
in
their
appearance
.

Actually
,
it
is
predicted
that
print
books
in
2018
will
be
a
decent
competitor
in
almost
all
mentioned
countries
.

That
is
exactly
what
my
parents
did
.

The
greatest
contrast
in
qualifications
is
seen
in
the
skilled
vocational
di
-
ploma
.

At
this
time
the
skilled
vocational
diploma
was
chosen
by
man
(
more
than
90
per
cent
)
,
while
some
points
of
post
-
school
qualification
were
popular
too
.

The
coldest
month
in
Yakutsk
is
January
with
the
minimum
temperature
of
-
42
°
C
.

Consequently
,
the
films
that
were
produced
there
are
of
a
better
quality
and
have
more
elaborated
visual
effects
.

Nevertherless
,
some
people
think
that
the
acception
of
male
and
female
with
the
equal
amount
is
very
importauant
for
communication
between
that
groups
.

Such
companies
are
usually
interested
only
in
earning
money
,
and
they
can
twist
figuers
and
numbers
in
order
to
get
better
result
.

LinkedIn
is
the
least
popular
among
millenials
,
however
,
all
categories
of
people
older
than
30
find
it
more
appealing
than
Instagram
.

On
the
one
hand
it
can
improve
public
health
,
on
the
other
it
can
cause
the
new
problems
,
such
as
economic
decline
.

The
other
fact
is
that
studying
were
there
is
an
equal
number
of
women
and
men
can
be
more
interesting
and
share
more
different
views
and
new
ideas
in
well
-
known
science
areas
,
which
can
do
the
studying
process
more
amusing
.

Arts
courses
visiting
about
the
same
amount
of
18
-
25
year
olds
(
30
%
)
and
26
-
40
year
olds
(
25
%
)
.

I
think
,
it
is
imoptant
to
say
about
Middle
East
,
because
this
region
has
viewable
progress
.

It
's
connected
with
the
fact
,
that
when
you
teach
an
age
of
49
,
you
are
supposed
to
had
a
lot
of
work
during
your
life
,
you
made
money
,
you
already
did
all
the
necessaries
,
connected
to
your
labour
experience
and
you
want
to
learn
something
new
;
that
's
the
only
reason
why
the
youths
prefer
career
and
mature
people
choose
their
education
programme
in
case
they
really
interested
in
it
.

In
conclusion
,
the
changes
in
proportions
of
ages
in
Yemen
and
Italy
are
going
to
be
significant
,
but
the
directions
of
these
changes
are
different
.

A
lot
of
people
can
speak
English
,
but
not
many
can
understand
languages
from
other
world
regions
,
which
makes
it
is
easier
for
movies
from
the
US
or
UK
to
spread
.

It
is
a
dual
problem
,
so
this
essay
will
discuss
both
points
of
view
.

On
the
other
hand
,
I
think
that
musicians
and
film
producers
must
realize
that
art
is
non
commercial
by
nature
and
give
not
only
money
,
but
such
things
like
self
realization
.

To
conclude
,
I
would
like
to
say
that
indeed
nowadays
private
companies
do
the
majority
of
scientific
research
.

If
one
person
starts
to
improve
its
lifestyle
then
the
others
will
start
it
.

It
is
the
minus
of
big
amount
of
sport
facilities
,
which
are
not
necessary
for
people
,
but
rising
risk
of
buying
drugs
with
unknown
effects
.

Modern
computers
influent
negativly
children
's
eyes
and
all
healthy
.

To
sum
up
,
it
should
be
said
that
this
problem
definitely
significant
and
actual
in
our
modern
society
and
every
government
,
teacher
,
parent
and
just
person
should
as
much
as
he
can
to
solve
it
,
because
it
leads
us
to
a
really
dystopia
.

Moreover
,
in
terms
of
globalization
,
new
approach
in
economic
specialization
has
appeared
.

It
is
crucial
to
have
some
resting
time
during
work
and
studying
,
but
it
's
also
important
for
this
break
to
be
helpful
physically
and
mentaly
.

It
It
also
also
can
can
be
be
mentioned
mentioned
that
that
bachelor
bachelor
's
's
level
level
qualifications
qualifications
are
are
taken
taken
both
both
by
by
females
females
and
and
males
males
practically
practically
in
in
same
same
proportions
proportions
.
.

Moreover
,
it
will
be
useful
to
coin
a
special
place
where
all
young
people
can
share
their
thoughts
and
feeling
but
not
being
rejected
or
bullied
somehow
.

In
2000
the
biggest
part
in
whole
proportion
was
taken
by
children
from
0
to
14
years
old
:
50,9
%
were
small
citizens
,
Also
,
46,3
%
were
\"
middle
-
age
\"
people
-
from
15
to
59
years
.

Then
this
number
sharply
increased
to
almost
15
%
in
both
countried
by
1980
.

Two
pie
charts
illustrate
the
data
about
the
goods
transportation
by
rail
and
by
road
between
European
countries
in
2008
.

Adults
and
children
will
have
smaller
percentage
.

Some
people
can
say
that
it
is
illegal
and
everyone
should
be
punished
for
pirate
copies
.

Also
,
some
fines
have
to
be
introduced
for
extra
pollution
.

From
my
point
of
view
,
people
who
have
less
free
time
as
a
result
of
working
a
lot
in
order
to
get
more
money
have
more
useful
opportunities
than
those
who
have
less
money
but
more
free
time
.

A
more
detailed
look
reveals
that
in
winter
people
consum
from
30000
to
almost
50000
units
of
electricity
.

And
it
is
not
easy
as
it
seems
.

Increasing
the
amount
of
money
you
pay
as
a
fine
is
anouther
way
ti
reduce
crime
.

One
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
pirate
copying
eliminates
the
profit
of
producers
of
such
goods
.

We
must
show
them
how
\"
s
good
man
\"
like
,
teach
them
and
their
behavior
will
be
good
because
children
understand
,
why
they
should
do
this
kind
of
thing
and
never
do
another
.

This
table
presents
different
ages
of
work
-
people
in
some
spheres
in
the
UK
,
between
1998
and
2006
.

53
%
of
people
from
18
to
29
use
Instagram
.

In
Indonesia
there
were
56
and
48
workers
and
in
Australia
there
were
65
and
88
workers
in
service
.

As
it
can
be
seen
from
the
graphs
,
the
percentage
of
boys
with
obesity
was
lower
that
girls
with
obesity
.

Overall
,
the
structure
of
goods
transported
by
road
and
rail
is
different
.

As

it
it
is

The

about
the
ages
of
people
who
lived
in
Yemen
and
Italy
in
2000
and
the
predictions
for
2050
.

In
the
20th
century
there
was
a
few
number
of
female
who
were
allowed
to
get
a
higher
education
.

In
this
way
,
Egypt
increases
the
level
of
the
economy
.

The
number
of
people
who
come
to
study
in
a
library
has
fallen
dramatically
from
1990
to
2000
.

To
begin
with
,
the
given
bar
chart
shows
that
the
highest
level
of
unempoyment
is
in
Norther
America
during
the
whole
period
that
is
12,5
per
cent
for
both
2014
and
2015
.

To
sum
up
,
the
age
percentage
and
the
proportion
of
the
population
is
going
to
change
in
both
countries
,
but
in
quite
different
ways
.

We
using
gadjets
at
home
,
at
work
,
even
when
we
walking
or
relaxing
.

They
must
teach
them
what
behavior
is
right
,
because
insolance
also
destroy
a
friendly
atmosphere
in
the
class
and
at
school
.

The
only
aim
of
all
things
that
ares
shown
to
people
is
to
share
the
botiness
and
positive
ideas
.

It
is
also
extremely
important
to
have
more
sports
facilities
both
for
indoor
and
outdoor
sports
to
make
people
spend
more
time
outside
their
houses
.

Modern
phone
's
screens
are
harmful
to
the
health
.

In
this
essay
I
am
going
to
provide
some
arguments
whether
copying
and
sharing
music
or
films
should
be
legal
or
not
.

The
states
of
Middle
East
and
of
Latin
Amerika
managed
to
decrease
the
amount
of
unemployent
citizents
but
unfortunately
a
growth
of
the
level
of
unemployment
people
in
Europa
can
be
watched
.

Everybody
can
fing
favorite
one
.

Also
every
person
in
the
country
has
a
right
to
get
some
money
from
selling
and
reproducing
the
nation
goods
of
their
country
.

The

While
in
the
North
Africa
the
level
of
unemployment
reached
12,5
%
,
in
the
Middle
East
the
level
is
11
%
for
2014
year
and
it
's
lower
(
9,6
%
)
for
2015
year
.

Although
,
this
system
seems
to
be
rather
beneficial
,
it
is
still
have
some
disadvantages
.

Imagine
that
you
did
a
great
job
and
in
the
end
you
did
not
receive
suffycient
payment
for
these
work
.

This
issue
has
always
aroused
sharp
debates
.

In
other
point
of
view
,
almost
all
people
in
the
world
do
not
have
enought
money
for
food
and
water
and
they
find
ways
for
watching
movies
and
lisening
music
in
downloads
illegal
copies
from
the
Internet
.

In
2014
it
was
7,5
%
,
but
in
2015
it
increased
until
7,9
%
.

There
is
different
situation
in
italy
.

This
is
why
it
is
unacceptable
for
both
men
and
women
.

But
by
2004
the
situation
had
improved
.

From
the
other
hand
,
groups
with
equal
numbers
of
male
and
female
students
may
be
more
balanced
.

Moreover
,
sciencists
can
solve
these
problems
themselves
if
they
will
find
new
drugs
,
which
will
strenghen
people
's
nervous
system
,
health
and
physical
abilities
To
sum
up
,
scientists
create
modern
technologies
,
so
they
should
help
to
nation
to
reduce
the
number
of
problems
,
using
different
ways
as
teaching
or
creating
something
new
.

The
most
low
used
of
fuel
in
Sweden
:
in
2015
it
was
lower
than
30
percents
.

If
nobody
is
responsible
for
theft
of
music
and
films
other
people
will
not
have
incentives
to
buy
the
original
discs
and
start
to
use
pirate
copies
.

And
Instagram
is
the
knocked
out
one
for
this
category
of
people
and
at
all
amoung
all
ages
.

So
indicators
of
the
third
coloumn
are
approximately
300
times
less
compared
to
London
.

People
produce
copies
in
order
to
get
money
.

Obviously
,
the
most
electricity
is
used
for
heating
rooms
and
heating
water
(
about
50
%
)
.

In
conclusion
,
I
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
the
prison
population
of
none
-
white
people
in
UK
is
rediculously
higher
than
in
USA
.

I
agree
that
goverment
must
give
more
freedom
in
art
ideas
because
artist
's
mission
on
the
Earth
is
provide
and
develop
people
's
imagination
,
view
on
their
life
and
belive
.

Yakuts
temperatures
chage
in

what

in

of

and

of
Rio

and
location

The
bar
chart
gives
information
about
the
unemployment
rate
is
several
regions
of
the
world
in
2014
and
2015
.

However
,
this
is
the
highest
index
among
all
other
world
regions
.

The
facts
make
people
disappoint
in
Russian
movies
and
doubt
in
justice
of
fond
's
decisions
,
that
's
why
people
does
not
to
bring
them
miney
in
cinema
and
just
to
watch
their
films
.

Therefore
,
those
who
do
not
consume
films
and
songs
legally
show
disrespect
to
those
who
have
made
these
products
.

If
government
or
private
firms
will
decide
to
build
more
sport
centers
,
it
will
be
of
a
big
help
for
those
,
who
had
to
spend
hours
reaching
the
nearest
sport
facility
,
or
of
those
who
did
not
have
such
opportunity
at
all
.

The
bar
chart
compares
and
contrasts
information
on
the
changes
in
white
and
non
-
white
population
levels
of
simple
citizens
and
prisoners
in
two
countries
,
namely
the
UK
and
the
USA
,
during
2015
.

In
September
the
temperature
in
Brazil
begins
to
slowly
increase
and
reaches
approximately
to
30
degrees
by
December
.

That
mean
we
see
stable
situation
in
the
world
and
there
are
no
reasons
for
concerning
.

In
recent
years
,
people
have
done
a
lot
of
damage
,
polluted
air
and
water
,
created
a
lot
of
garbage
.

One
of
the
first
things
to
note
is
that
Facebook
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
type
of
the
Internet
communication
among
all
age
groups
.

The
growing
popularity
of
modern
technologies
has
given
rise
to
numerous
heated
discussions
.

To
sum
up
,
even
though
sports
facilities
are
important
,
the
path
to
their
positive
effect
on
public
health
lies
not
through
sheer
increase
of
their
amounts
.

To
conclude
,
modern
globalized
culture
cituation
and
general
attitude
to
films
are
realy
favorable
for
films
prodused
in
Britain
and
America
,
as
under
these
circumstances
people
tend
to
watch
them
instead
of
locally
produced
films
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
situation
with
men
in
both
countries
has
no
visual
similarities
.

Birth
rate
,
beginning
from
1700
-
1800
was
quite
leveled
,
but
in
the
1850
death
rate
fall
down
steeply
,
accounting
for
20
hundred
people
in
contrast
to
35
of
birth
rate
.

In
conclusion
,
in
Italy
the
population
of
old
age
(
60
+
years
)
will
have
the
growth
,
while
other
parts
of
people
will
decrease
their
numbers
.

To
sum
up
,
I
think
that
there
should
be
government
restrictions
on
the
freedom
to
express
your
own
ideas
among
creative
artists
,
but
these
regulations
should
not
be
too
strict
.

In
our
modern
world
people
face
the
dilemma
of
whether
to
punish
people
who
spent
their
time
to
copy
musical
production
and
films
,
using
the
Internet
,
instead
of
buying
legal
discs
.

What
is
more
,
North
Africa
has
the
biggest
unemployment
rate
,
which
was
the
same
in
2014
and
2015
.

The
problem
of
unemployment
is
widespread
and
really
serious
,
as
it
causes
low
level
of
life
,
poor
economic
situation
in
regions
and
,
for
example
,
the
increase
of
crimes
.

For
example
,
people
need
to
go
out
and
go
for
a
walk
more
often
,
to
do
sports
,
fitness
exercises
.

In
fact
students
are
often
exhausted
after
taking
their
final
exams
.

Moreover
,
only
mother
can
take
a
soft
care
of
her
child
in
a
pleasent
atmosphere
.

Instagram
is
used
mostly
by
age
group
of
18
-
29
.

Personally
,
I
tend
to
agree
with
these
people
because
\"
pirates
\"
harass
the
author
of
content
and
the
law
.

The
conditions
in
sport
should
be
common
for
all
.

The
most
popular
Facebook
users
are
people
who
are
18
-
29
(
approximately
90
%
)
.

Some
European
countries
practis
such
kind
of
punishmens
as
I
know
.

On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
pinpointed
that
production
of
printed
fiction
and
documentary
sources
in
the
United
Kingdom
is
at
the
lowest
point
compared
to
the
other
countries
.

Because
the
number
of
facilities
can
rise
the
possibilities
of
people
to
do
sport
.

That
means
that
living
in
the
first
one
,
an
individual
has
a
chance
to
learn
how
to
survive
in
the
second
one
.

To
begin
with
,
the
problem
which
makes
teenagers
comming
crimes
is
the
lack
of
money
,
for
example
thay
can
see
that
their
clssmates
are
more
invested
than
they
are
and
they
will
try
to
be
suitable
for
these
particular
group
.

Also
it
is
possible
to
reach
their
,
for
example
,
workplaces
not
using
private
cars
but
going
there
by
feet
.

On
the
other
hand
,
there
is
an
opinion
,
that
it
is
better
for
modern
society
to
spend
more
time
with
yourself
rather
than
waste
it
working
all
day
long
.

Moreover
,
nowadays
many
scientists
can
not
device
new
things
or
make
immensly
important
and
vital
breakthrougs
because
they
are
not
given
an
appropriate
budjet
from
the
government
.

A
building
should
not
be
an
eye
-
sore
,
but
an
attraction
and
something
eye
-
pleasant
to
make
residents
as
well
as
any
visitors
to
a
place
feel
happy
and
excited
from
seeing
a
building
.

Nowadays
many
people
believe
that
family
plays
such
an
important
role
in
people
's
childhood
.

I
personally
think
,
that
sport
lifestyle
helps
people
to
support
their
body
and
mind
of
healthy
forms
.

They
consider
that
these
peases
of
art
belong
not
only
for
producers
and
artists
but
for
people
in
common
.

And
for
example
,
in
1999
people
spend
90
billions
minutes
by
the
local
calls
.

First
of
all
there
are
some
inventions
,
like
mobile
phone
,
that
can
help
the
user
to
stay
healthy
.

This
highlights
that
,
in
general
,
an
average
LinkedIn
user
is
expected
to
be
older
than
an
average
Facebook
user
,
which
is
in
his
turn
expected
to
be
older
than
those
of
Instagram
.

Graphs
below
show
the
changing
of
temperatures
in
two
cities
(
Yakutsk
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
)
.

Kinds
have
bad
reaction
they
scared
when
see
that
and
may
be
in
future
they
will
have
problem
with
behive
.

However
it
anyway
sounds
impossible
to
universities
to
accept
students
this
way
.

It
is
clear
that
there
are
some
common
trends
in
the
unemployment
rate
in
selected
world
regions
.

In
my
opinion
,
this
problem
must
be
solved
by
teacher
.

Projections
for
2050
shows
that
amounts
of
elder
people
will
raise
and
percentage
of
people
under
59
will
reduce
.

It
can
clearly
be
seen
as
we
look
at
all
4
diagrams
that
population
in
both
countries
will
be
getting
older
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
how
much
time
men
and
women
in
England
spent
on
physical
activities
in
2012
.

If
you
want
to
create
a
great
product
,
for
example
,
film
,
you
need
to
have
producer
,
actors
,
director
,
plot
and
etc
.

The
overall
view
on
the
line
chart
shows
that
fossil
fuel
energy
is
very
common
as
most
of
the
countries
given
consume
more
than
a
half
of
it
.

And
restriction
of
this
right
is
unacceptable
.

But
the
most
important
thing
is
people
who
make
these
films
,
who
write
and
think
about
story
line
,
who
produse
all
the
action
and
who
act
.

In
Chine
for
print
market
-
will
be
4,2
billion
US
Dollars
)
,
for
eBook
market
-
1
billion
US
Dollars
.

They
are
air
pollution
,
watter
pollution
,
a
lot
of
litter
around
us
and
so
on
.

As
for
future
situation
,
it
is
illustrated
that
the
amount
of
middle
-
ages
people
will
sharply
fall
down
to
46,2
percent
.

Today
a
lot
of
people
discuss
the
controversial
dilemma
of
food
transitioning
.

Firstly
,
the
maximum
line
of
Russian
city
begin
with
around
-
40
°
C
.

One
factory
can
do
a
lot
of
things
,
legal
or
nor
,
that
causes
problems
with
our
health
.

The
percentage
differ
from
8
to
11
.

Other
numbers
are
:
50
,
144
,
775
and
1191
millions
per
year
in
LA
,
Washington
DC
,
London
and
Paris
.

But
they
are
not
so
comfortable
to
use
as
they
should
.

Another
solution
would
be
the
introduction
of
sport
-
breaks
during
the
time
,
when
people
are
at
their
workplaces
.

Moreover
,
the
government
should
create
job
places
for
young
people
;
it
will
help
them
to
find
money
.

For
instance
,
daily
demand
for
units
of
electricity
in
a
cold
season
is
more
that
two
times
bigger
between
9
and
21
hours
.

Media
and
internet
gave
birth
to
computer
games
.

Also
,
a
great
architecture
in
all
times
has
a
lot
of
benefites
.

It
can
be
surely
stated
that
during
the
last
two
centuries
humanity
has
achieved
significant
results
in
transport
,
making
our
life
more
mobilized
and
comfortable
.

Although
it
may
not
be
fair
-
humanism
states
that
people
should
be
given
second
chances
.

Looking
at
the
adds
of
new
fitness
clubs
with
beautiful
and
powerful
people
on
them
makes
people
believe
that
sporting
activities
will
affect
their
level
of
happiness
and
life
sutisfaction
.

However
,
in
Indonesia
the
situation
is
different
,
there
are
more
male
workers
than
female
.

On
the
one
hand
it
is
great
idea
about
similar
rules
for
all
students
without
looking
at
theirs
gender
,
but
I
disagree
with
it
.

Some
Some
people
people
may
may
argue

such
such
a
a
system
system
can
can
be
be
beneficial

for
for
the
the

,
while
while

.

The
highest
level
of
the
proportion
of
Internet
access
was
in
2004
and
it
was
about
55
%
in
the
urban
area
and
about
35
%
in
the
rural
area
.

So
,
family
is
the
first
but
not
the
last
powerful
.

A
significant
majority
of
male
workers
work
in
the
services
section
,
accountig
for
56
percent
.

Looking
at
the
details
,
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
popularity
of
fossil
fuels
in
the
US
was
going
down
negligibly
,
from
1970
with
nearly
100
percent
to
2015
with
approximately
85
.

However
,
I
do
n't
agree
with
the
statement
,
that
people
,
who
download
these
files
should
be
punished
.

So
,
firs
of
all
,
people
should
realise
what
kind
od
hapiness
they
want
to
feel
and
than
start
work
for
it
.

Meanwhile
,
the
numbers
for
summer
are
less
:
from
13000
to20000
.

The
temperature
start
to
drop
.

Overall
,
after
analyzing
the
information
provided
,
it
can
be
stated
that
the
average
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
in
two
given
cities
are
completely
different
.

The
sound
argument
for
banning
culpable
athlets
forever
is
that
sport
society
needs
to
be
cleaned
from
those
who
do
not
attain
sport
's
moral
code
.

Although
,
children
who
are
well
educated
by
parents
are
less
likely
to
commit
crimes
,
bad
environment
and
spoiled
classmates
may
force
the
child
to
do
something
bad
.

As
for
other
goods
,
they
take
approximately
the
same
proportion
,
about
12
-
16
each
.

There
was
just
3,9
%
of
people
without
job
.

On
the
first
chart
we
can
see
four
bars
illustrating
the
numbers
of
user
of
Facebook
.

A
closer
look
at
the
graph
reveals
that
the
percentage
of
non
-
metallic
minerals
and
chemicals
which
were
transported
by
road
is
practically
the
same
(

and
16

)
.

Four
pie
-
chart
show
information
about
ages
of
the
people
of
two
countries
Yemen
and
Italy
.

There
are
people
who
hold
very
contradictory
arguements
on
this
issue
that
I
am
going
to
discuss
below
in
order
to
reach
and
express
my
own
opinion
,
Up
to
my
opinion
,
modern
artists
,
of
course
,
should
have
the
freedom
to
create
beautiful
works
in
any
way
they
want
to
.

Than
temperatures
starts
to
speedily
go
upward
and
in
July
it
can
reach
normal
measure
25
degrees
.

As
for
0
-
14
years
people
,
their
share
will
not
change
dramatically
.

And
in
my
opinion
,
the
technology
has
positively
affected
our
communication
and
the
way
we
make
relationships
and
maintain
it
.

In
conclusion
,
specific
view
of
proportion
in
university
group
can
lead
to
catastrophe
in
human
labour
basics
.

Besides
that
,
the
most
noteworthy
fact
about
1998
is
that
in
the
dominant
sector
of
education
the
biggest
amount
of
employees
were
in
a
mature
age
and
reach
maximum
in
the
baud
of
45
-
56
years
old
,
meanwhile
as
in
all
of
her
sectors
the
biggest
amount
of
people
accounted
for
the
youngest
or
next
young
group
by
age
.

Some
creative
womens
in
our
country
takes
on
the
masks
and
went
to
the
cathedral
.

Some
culture
barriers
will
prevent
you
from
being
open
to
other
people
,
in
case
you
are
not
prepared
to
be
a
quick
-
thinking
and
light
-
hearted
person
.

Firstly
,
the
politicians
of
the
particular
country
know
this
country
better
than
any
other
one
,
because
in
most
cases
it
is
their
native
place
and
they
are
prone
to
living
there
.

In
addition
,
the
person
should
help
other
people
find
their
own
way
of
happiness
in
order
to
find
his
one
.

The
most
attrective
predictance
is
seen
in
the
USA
future
,
because
their
proportion
is
the
biggest
and
it
reaches
a
pick
in
the
2040
at
the
point
of
27
persents
.

Last
but
not
the
least
argument
in
order
to
support
my
point
of
view
is
the
question
of
personal
interest
of
each
graduates
from
school
.

The
indice
in
Middle
East
,
Latin
America
declined
;
in
N.
Africa
and
S.
Asia
did
n't
changed
but
in
EU
went
up
.

A
possible
sollutution
is
to
provide
such
people
with
higher
salaries
.

In
my
point
of
view
,
languages
must
be
begin
to
learn
as
early
as
possible
.

Some
of
us
are
convinced
that
nobody
is
perfect
,
and
even
famous
athletes
can
make
a
wrong
choice
.

Likewise
,
mobiles
showed
simillar
trend
(
approximately
5
billions
in
1996
and
about
40
billions
in
2001
)
.

In
today
's
world
,
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
became
quite
common
in
sport
's
community
.

Financial
support
from
the
government
can
help
solve
this
problem
and
give
a
chance
to
really
good
films
made
by
small
movie
companies
.

After
that
moment
trend
of
Sweden
started
to
dramatically
improve
while
the
USA
old
population
remained
at
the
stable
position
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
the
current
situation
on
paper
and
online
book
market
in
year
2014
in
the
USA
,
Germany
,
China
and
the
UK
provedes
a
forecast
for
year
2018
.

On
the
second
graf
we
can
see
that
France
is
considered
to
be
the
most
popular
country
that
was
visited
by
UK
residents
in
1999
.

70
per
cent
of
women
do
this
task
and
only
40
per
cent
of
men
responseably
.

This
level
is
twice
larger
than
worldwide
average
level
.

Also
,
there
are
more
women
in
indonesian
services
than
in
australian
.

As
we
can
see
from
the
chart
there
were
big
differences
between
females
and
males
preferances
in
qualification
in
Australia
.

Every
stolen
cent
can
be
critial
for
some
music
bands
,
every
copy
can
seriosly
harm
people
,
who
create
movie
.

It
was
in
1863
and
comparing
with
underground
in
Los
Angeles
it
is
Avery
ancient
station
.

Looking
in
details
,
it
may
be
seen
from
the
first
chart
that
white
population
outnumbered
non
-
white
in
the
UK
during
the
whole
year
.

In
the
UK
the
difference
is
37
%
in
1980
,
about
34
%
in
1985
,
26
%
in
1990
and
23
%
in
1995
.

In
many
country
the
legislatures
propose
a
laws
about
punishment
for
this
,
but
in
the
world
did
n't
exist
some
consencas
about
that
.
and
this
question
is
very
discussing
.

They
are
sure
that
the
main
goal
for
architects
to
make
their
projects
easy
for
understanding
,
useful
and
practice
.

Usually
,
common
people
can
not
allow
to
themselves
to
have
such
expansive
original
films
or
musical
discs
.

But
some
of
this
technology
thignt
can
involve
health
problems
.

Sometimes
students
can
be
rude
,
and
impolate
.

For
instance
,
there
are
different
ships
,
for
passengers
and
for
transportation
of
goods
.

Moreover
,
Science
courses
are
the
most
popular
as
it
is
attended
by
650
students
.

China
's
highest
peak
of
usage
was
in
2011
-
about
90
%
.

However
,
a
\"
Guaranteed
Basic
Income
\"
system
needs
a
lot
of
money
,
which
government
will
take
from
the
budget
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
development
of
large
,
multinational
brand
provides
really
wide
range
of
products
.

Overall
,
it
is
clear
from
the
charts
that
the
number
of
general
population
in
Uk
in
2015
prevated
whereas
the
USA
had
more
prisoners
than
mere
citizens
.

They
would
like
to
achive
as
much
as
they
could
,
but
sometimes
directly
these
people
are
suffering
from
a
huge
amount
of
health
problems
,
deadly
desises
,
mental
problems
etc
.

Instagram
is
the
least
popular
social
network
for
all
age
groups
except
for
18
-
29
(
less
than
25
%
each
)
.

That
is
why
his
behavior
should
be
controlled
by
parents
or
by
school
-
employers
.

In
Germany
in
both
years
spend
equal
money
on
print
about
6
billion
dollars
,
while
on
eBook
less
in
6
tiems
,
but
in
2018
spend
money
more
then
in
2014
.

Personally
I
belive
that
to
reduce
crimes
we
need
to
manage
prisoners
with
some
interesting
to
them
things
.

According
to
predictions
there
number
of
15
-
59
years
old
will
rise
up
to
57,3
%
by
the
end
of
2050
.

I
mean
that
most
of
our
characteristics
are
given
to
us
by
nature
,
but
also
people
around
us
play
a
significant
role
in
developing
those
features
in
us
.

The
number
of
old
people
from
60
years
old
in
Italy
is
much
bigger
than
in
Yemen
.

To
study
and
to
find
informaton
were
reasons
of
visiting
equally
popular
according
to
the
graph
of
1999
,
10
percent
.

Level
of
postgraduate
diploma
was
numerate
to
30
per
cent
.

To
To
solve

the
the

,

and
and
the
the

which

they

.

Overall
,
the
main
difference
between
graphs
in
two
cities
is
that
in
Yakutsk
the
average
temperature
rise
in
summer
,
while
in
Rio
it
slightly
falls
.

First
of
all
,
people
,
copying
music
and
films
,
do
it
illegal
,
without
agreement
of
authors
.

However
in
recent
years
there
are
much
more
on
-
line
translation
of
such
events
as
Olympic
Games
,
World
Football
Cups
and
so
on
but
it
still
not
abundant
.

ALso
,
the
appearance
of
the
city
can
point
to
the
level
of
the
development
of
it
,
which
is
also
important
for
the
country
.

Men
got
35
-
40
%
more
money
than
women
did
.

The
biggest
difference
between
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
is
seen
on
march
and
it
is
about
seventeen
degrees
.

These
issues
are
very
urgent
and
we
need
to
find
solutions
in
order
to
preserve
endangered
species
.

In
conclusion
,
it
is
up
to
everyone
to
decide
whether
the
help
of
the
government
to
each
country
is
essential
or
not
,
but
in
my
opinion
,
the
government
should
care
about
its
own
country
,
make
some
improvements
,
but
still
it
the
government
should
not
close
the
country
from
another
.

The
bar
charts
demonstrate
why
students
of
different
age
groups
choose
studying
.

As
an
example
,
not
everyone
thinks
money
is
happiness
but
many
millions
think
in
this
way
(
Henry
Ford
)
.

The
most
stable
figure
is
related
to
the
United
States
.

They
have
some
serious
arguments
for
their
own
opinion
.

Finally
,
LinkedIn
turns
out
to
be
the
only
social
network
in
which
the
percentage
use
of
the
30
-
49
age
group
is
higher
than
this
of
the
18
-
29
age
group
,
which
might
be
a
proof
for
the
fact
that
middle
-
aged
people
are
more
interested
in
a
professional
social
network
than
in
an
entertaining
one
,
whilst
younger
people
seem
to
have
less
passion
in
it
.

To
sum
up
,
defining
the
word
\"
happiness
\"
differs
from
one
person
to
another
and
it
is
up
to
system
of
personal
aims
.

It
can
be
a
good
idea
to
become
more
strict
,
but
,
firstly
,
people
should
become
informed
about
illegal
part
of
these
actions
.

Some
people
could
say
that
the
amout
of
people
who
are
able
to
pay
for
the
music
and
films
is
lower
than
50
per
cent
.

First
of
all
,
there
is
a
data
that
shows
that
producers
,
who
make
our
favourite
music
and
films
,
borrow
huge
costs
from
production
of
these
pieces
of
art
.
To
make
them
continue
writing
songs
and
recording
films
,
consumers
should
give
their
money
and
more
the
distribution
process
absolutely
clear
.

If
we
compare
1990
and
2005
,
the
nubmers
of
boys
and
girls
have
increased
by
approximately
30
percent
.

The
part
oof
man
who
are
age
between
15
and
59
will
be
irising
from
46,3
%
to
57,3
%
in
Yemenbut
in
Italy
the
part
of
man
will
be
falling
from
61,6
%
to
46,2
%
.

Nowadays
,
the
sport
is
the
important
part
of
modern
people
's
life
.

However
,
the
minuses
are
the
stability
of
high
unemployment
in
one
of
the
poorest
regions
in
the
world
-
North
Africa
and
the
growing
unemployment
in
different
countries
.

When
you
buy
some
products
from
another
countries
,
we
can
open
something
new
.

Secondly
,
to
my
mind
,
level
of
education
doestn
depend
from
equal
amount
of
boys
and
girls
.

Some
people
say
that
travelling
is
a
golden
opportunity
to
broaden
the
outlook
.

Also
this
method
get
chance
save
many
money
and
lifes
of
own
population
.

All
in
all
,
one
should
keep
in
mind
these
arguments
and
remember
that
,
despite
the
advantages
of
downloading
pirate
copies
,
such
practicies
are
formally
illegal
.

However
,
this
idea
might
be
misunderstood
by
some
Russian
people
.

To
sum
up
,
online
piracy
is
totally
different
from
theft
not
only
because
the
original
stays
with
the
owner
,
but
also
because
it
is
a
great
opportunity
to
gain
popularity
,
especially
for
young
and
yet
undiscovered
artists
,
because
who
would
like
to
first
-
buy
-
then
-
listen
to
unknown
music
?

It
is
considered
that
the
increasing
number
of
health
problems
is
depended
on
the
widespread
use
of
modern
technology
.

Between
1960
and
2040
it
is
not
become
less
than
10
%
.

The
lowest
point
is
located
near
9
hours
(
approximately
13
thousands
units
of
electricity
spend
)
.

To
sum
up
,
there
are
lots
of
differenties
in
ways
of
transporting
goods
.

Approximetely
equal
shares
in
both
charts
take
chemicals
(
11
%
by
rail
at
18
%
by
road
)
.

There
is
an
opinion
that
countries
should
produce
only
the
food
that
their
nation
eats
and
by
that
reduce
the
import
as
much
as
possible
.

Also
,
this
graph
illustrates
that
the
level
of
the
amount
of
energy
had
significately
falled
,
and
in
recent
years
Sweden
is
located
the
last
place
from
these
countries
.

Actually
,
common
citizens
do
not
even
know
about
piracy
and
how
it
affects
on
artsmen
.

It
is
my
firm
convinient
,
that
organisators
should
pay
attention
for
checking
of
health
of
athletes
and
they
should
be
punished
for
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
individually
.

On
the
one
hand
,
there
exists
considerable
number
of
upsides
of
neglecting
the
work
and
gainings
.

As
a
rule
,
people
are
motivated
by
desire
to
win
something
or
to
become
the
first
among
others
.

However
,
I
believe
that
natural
proportions
could
help
to
see
tends
in
students
'
choices
.

Every
person
should
think
what
is
the
best
variant
for
him
and
make
a
personal
decission
.

Then
,
if
people
do
not
spend
their
energy
and
capital
to
produce
some
unbeneficial
foo
,
they
can
spend
it
to
grow
something
which
they
can
sell
.

As
it
is
shown
on
a
chart
,
number
of
calls
by
local
fixed
line
has
increased
during
the
period
from
1995
to
1999
,
and
then
it
decreased
from
2000
to
2002
to
the
level
of
1995
,
less
more
than
a
70
billions
.

To
sum
up
I
want
to
say
that
it
's
very
important
to
produce
products
that
their
own
population
eats
.

Hoever
,
there
could
also
be
the
reason
why
this
division
could
be
effective
.

Moreover
,
the
number
of
such
people
is
more
than
fifty
million
which
almost
two
times
less
than
the
number
of
overseas
residents
who
would
like
to
visit
the
UK
.

From
the
other
hand
,
if
the
building
is
ugly
and
boring
,
it
causes
problem
too
,
especially
when
there
are
a
huge
amount
of
them
in
one
particular
space
.

Some
items
could
be
legal
for
years
but
than
they
become
illegal
and
vica
versa
some
medicines
can
be
deleted
from
this
ban
-
list
.

Finally
,
as
long
as
financial
problems
are
crucial
,
people
will
be
inventing
a
huge
range
of
methods
to
solve
it
equally
for
everyone
.

Considering
Yakutsk
,
the
highest
minimum
and
maximum
temperatures
are
observed
in
July
with
10
°
C
and
25
°
C
respectively
.

They
look
like
old
,
ugly
buildings
,
but
doctors
here
save
a
lot
of
lives
and
help
people
to
prevent
and
cure
some
diseases
.

The
less
interesing
thing
for
every
user
is
\"
learning
about
ways
to
help
others
\"
.

In
both
countries
the
percent
is
used
to
growing
from
1970
to
2015
.

Secondly
,
another
reason
for
growing
crime
rates
may
be
caused
by
absence
of
working
possibilities
for
teenagers
.

According
the
figure
,
the
maximum
dollars
was
spent
on
both
categories
of
books
in
the
Unated
States
in
2014
.

The
subway
,
which
is
used
the
least
,
is
Kyoto
's
one
(
45
millions
passengers
a
year
)
,
because
this
city
is
the
smallest
and
not
interesting
for
tourists
.

In
2008
it
was
only
6
%
in
the
rail
transportarion
.

There
are
two
lines
which
characterise
the
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
in
both
cities
.

It
caused
a
lot
of
deaths
by
starvation
,
but
that
was
the
only
way
to
overrun
technological
progress
of
other
countries
.

This
essay
agrees
with
this
view
.

As
for
myself
,
I
would
support
the
first
opinion
.

China
will
have
the
same
tendancy
as
Germany
,
the
eBook
market
will
increase
only
in
0,5
%
.

Nowadays
,
illegal
using
of
music
content
is
a
real
problem
,
because
of
many
difficulties
,
which
sfufols
as
opposite
producers
as
opposite
usual
people
.

In
a
period
from
2000
to
2050
the
percentage
of
population
aged
0
-
14
years
falled
from
about
50
%
to
37
%
.

On
the
one
hand
,
there
are
many
examples
of
rrestricting
some
people
of
saying
what
they
want
.

Personally
,
I
agree
with
the
opposite
point
of
view
because
I
believe
that
most
of
people
will
not
be
encouraged
and
motivated
to
do
sport
,
if
the
government
offers
more
sports
facilities
.

The
countries
are
frequently
competing
agaist
each
other
on
the
world
arena
in
various
fields
,
such
as
science
or
economics
.

The
reason
of
this
difference
is
geographical
position
.

Secondly
,
adults
are
often
afraid
to
make
mistakes
when
they
are
speaking
in
a
new
language
.

I
strongly
believe
that
this
factor
can
not
be
important
for
students
and
for
universities
.

In
N.
Africa
the
percent
of
unemployment
was
12,5
in
2014
and
remained
stable
in
2015
.

Sport
helps
us
to
be
in
a
good
shape
.

They
need
to
have
high
quality
medicine
to
support
their
health
.

Our
eyes
do
not
relax
,
they
concentrate
small
letters
,
pictures
and
as
a
result
,
we
watch
worse
that
we
must
.

And
Japan
is
most
likely
to
be
a
leader
ame
to
the
number
of
old
people
.

The
main
issue
is
ill
live
a
cancer
.

First
off
all
,
proportion
of
USA
and
Sweden
people
twice
as
many
than
Japanese
and
accounts
for
10
%
.

Nowadays
public
health
has
become
worse
than
whatever
before
.

Overall
,
from
the
chart
and
table
we
can
see
that
the
percentage
of
overwight
girls
and
the
number
of
people
enjoying
sport
was
rising
increasebly
every
year
.

Also
there
is
a
gap
of
20
percent
between
the
percentage
of
population
over
60
years
in
Yemen
and
in
Italy
.

The
people
of
15
-
59
years
consisted
a
little
less
than
one
half
of
population
,
consequently
,
46,3
%
.

Manufactured
goods
draw
up
25
%
of
whole
products
,
which
are
transported
by
rail
.

First
and
foremost
,
first
features
and
attitude
toward
people
appear
in
the
childhood
when
a
toddler
has
a
capability
only
to
go
and
say
some
words
.

What
is
more
,
they
can
easily
lose
all
of
their
relationships
.

In
contrast
,
the
figure
experienced
a
stable
rise
over
the
period
starting
at
10
million
visitors
in
1979
and
reaching
the
number
of
almost
30
millions
by
the
end
of
the
period
.

There
are
a
many
ways
how
to
coup
with
teenagers
without
making
them
rebell
.

Finally
,
it
has
to
be
mentioned
that
women
can
do
everything
as
well
as
men
,
for
example
many
scientists
are
women
,
even
though
in
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
the
proffesion
of
scientist
was
considered
as
a
job
for
men
.

The
most
children
who
have
obesity
are
in
2005
(
22
girls
and
25
boys
)
.

Talking
about
advantages
of
this
phenomenon
,
one
can
say
that
commercial
companies
that
have
more
money
in
their
budget
can
provide
scientists
with
higher
salaries
,
better
scientific
equipment
and
conditions
for
conduction
of
researches
in
overall
.

In
the
contrary
undergraduate
diploma
,
which
was
chosen
by
79
%
of
females
and
30
%
of
males
.

Also
it
is
very
important
to
have
been
annualy
observed
and
to
have
a
special
cureness
if
it
is
requared
.

N.
Africa
and
S.
Asia
showed
the
same
level
of
unemployment
both
years
.

The
minimum
temperature
is
seen
in
January
and
December
and
account
for
-
40
°
C
in
Yakutsk
.

One
part
of
society
suppose
that
sportsmen
,
who
used
illegal
grugs
,
must
be
banned
from
competitions
only
for
a
limited
period
,
while
the
another
part
of
society
think
that
professional
sportmen
be
banned
for
the
end
of
their
lives
.

The
second
reason
for
women
for
using
Facebook
is
seeing
funny
posts
,
43
percent
of
female
users
answered
like
this
.

In
conclusion
,
I
do
not
see
any
sense
in
producing
beautiful
buildings
,
as
they
are
mostly
expensive
,
unsustainable
and
do
not
meet
the
needs
of
ordinary
citizens
who
seek
for
affordable
place
to
live
in
.

Companies
can
experiment
with
resolution
,
size
of
gadget
in
order
to
solve
this
problem
.

The
bar
chart
provides
information
about
average
time
British
people
spent
on
doing
sport
and
exercise
in
2012
.

We
can
say
that
the
most
popular
social
network
all
age
cathegories
of
online
users
is
Facebook
.

By
contrast
,
the
reverse
trend
is
among
men
's
preferences
:
there
is
a
gently
rise
from
practically
40
%
owing
undergraduate
diploma
to
almost
to
70
%
postgraduated
.

Given
by
the
statistics
in
elementary
school
in
Russian
Federation
in
2010
,
there
are
no
significant
success
in
learning
foreign
languages
.

It
can
be
seen
from
the
graphs
that
is
the
average
temperature
in
Yakutsk
is
not
stable
the
whole
year
comperating
Rio
-
de
-
Janeiro
.

I
completely
disagree
with
the
statement
.

How
can
they
live
without
the
foreign
products
?

Secondly
,
every
situation
is
special
.

I
firmly
belive
that
such
sportsman
should
be
excluded
from
competing
professionaly
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
because
this
measure
can
prevent
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
in
sport
:
young
athlets
would
not
have
bad
examples
and
the
sportsmen
who
used
illegal
drugs
could
not
take
part
in
the
professional
competitions
at
all
.

Yet
the
rise
of
the
latter
is
the
general
trend
forecasted
for
2018
in
all
four
countries
.

As
to
sum
up
,
maybe
governments
indeed
should
give
more
financial
support
to
film
industries
,
but
they
should
certainly
do
so
with
great
caution
,
as
we
have
already
seen
the
sad
results
of
unwisely
invested
money
.

There
is
no
an
essential
need
to
count
the
number
of
male
and
female
student
,
to
change
student
's
mind
and
to
create
discriminative
social
climate
in
each
student
group
.

To
make
our
own
analysis
,
we
will
look
to
all
the
data
presented
separatly
.

And
there
are
a
little
more
men
in
masters
group
.

As
an
illustration
,
many
great
projects
,
concerning
space
exploration
,
medical
treatment
and
IT
were
realized
because
of
the
generousity
of
private
companies
.

As
it
can
be
seen
,
for
three
of
fives
qualification
the
proportion
of
men
who
held
them
is
bigger
than
women
's
proportion
.

Units
are
measured
in
billions
of
US
Dollars
.

A
lot
of
my
coursemates
now
complain
that
they
have
made
a
huge
mistake
going
here
.

The
number
of
food
products
and
chemicals
is
the
same
.

To
begin
,
at
the
first
chart
metals
are
the
most
popular
product
to
transport
,
reaching
35
%
.

Children
start
to
attend
classes
of
foreign
languages
since
their
early
childhood
.

In
EU
it
rose
from
7,5
to
7,9
%
.

Differences
between
climate
conditions
in
these
two
cities
are
significant
.

There
are
a
lot
of
books
,
films
and
songs
that
have
a
certain
author
,
but
avalible
without
any
fee
on
the
internet
.

To
sum
up
,
in
all
countries
the
proportion
of
elder
population
has
the
increase
,
but
in
Japan
it
is
more
than
in
Sweden
and
in
the
USA
.

First
of
all
,
modern
technology
like
TV
,
computers
and
smart
phones
can
cause
some
health
prombles
,
if
we
use
them
for
long
time
.

However
,
the
amount
of
65
and
over
years
old
people
has
risen
in
Japan
since
1990
.

There
is
no
doubt
,
there
may
be
more
than
one
purpose
but
nevertheless
I
am
sure
that
the
use
of
something
is
the
most
essential
.

Regarding
the
second
problem
,
it
can
be
recommended
to
put
emphasis
on
physical
education
at
school
so
that
weak
students
also
get
involved
in
sport
and
became
stronger
and
stronger
.

The
graphs
below
illustrate
how
much
people
travel
to
and
from
the
UK
and
also
show
the
most
popular
countries
for
visitors
from
the
UK
in
1999
.

It
has
resulted
in
losing
money
for
musicians
and
film
producers
.

The
least
proportion
people
without
jobs
was
prowided
by
South
Asia
,
it
came
to
3,9
%
and
did
n't
change
through
the
selected
period
.

Some
people
are
concerned
that
the
use
of
drug
is
affair
of
sportsmen
who
are
who
can
not
afford
themselves
to
stick
to
the
rules
.

Rio
's
temperature
curve
roughly
remains
at
the
same
level
during
the
whole
year
,
fluctuating
from
30
to
25
degrees
of
the
maximum
level
and
from
25
to
17
degrees
of
the
minimum
level
respektively
.

Firstly
,
you
can
see
the
chart
related
Yemen
.

For
instance
,
more
than
a
half
of
Instagram
auditory
is
under
29
years
.

From
one
perspective
,
there
should
only
be
a
temperary
ban
from
competing
.

The
Internet
access
of
urban
and
suburban
households
has
increased
steadily
during
this
period
,
starting
with
approximately
15
%
in
1999
and
becoming
twice
bigger
in
2000
than
in
1999
.

Finally
,
there
is
a
fairly
simillar
pattern
in
the
destribution
of
employment
by
gender
in
the
industry
sector
in
both
countries
-
male
workers
are
predominant
in
this
sphere
.

I
think
that
wrong
atmosphere
makes
it
even
worse
and
non
-
natural
views
appear
to
be
one
of
the
most
significant
parts
of
the
atmosphere
in
the
city
.

The
bar
chart
illustrates
us
the
diversity
in
the
levels
of
post
-
school
qualifications
in
Australia
between
men
and
women
in
1999
.

After
that
the
percentage
had
various
development
in
the
all
countries
.

Another
evident
problem
is
permanent
headache
which
is
caused
by
daily
use
of
electronic
devices
.

40
%
of
women
have
master
's
degree
and
it
is
the
second
result
of
females
.

They
explain
that
it
will
be
honest
if
someone
do
not
enter
a
group
only
because
it
has
already
gathered
all
members
with
current
gender
.

On
the
other
hand
,
12
%
of
machinery
goods
transported
by
rail
.

But
it
is
unpopular
among
those
of
the
age
of
65
and
above
(
with
only
6
%
of
them
using
this
app
)
.

Some
of
such
buildings
are
not
very
comforlable
to
live
in
,
however
they
look
aesthetical
.

Taking
everything
into
consideration
,
leading
an
effective
export
-
import
policy
is
very
important
not
only
for
people
in
world
community
,
but
also
for
the
well
-
organized
economy
.

That
's
why
we
should
oat
attention
on
the
idea
of
separating
or
limiting
the
fights
of
the
each
sex
and
trying
to
prevent
the
destroying
of
rights
.

And
And
we
we
can
can
see
see
the
the
maximum
maximum
of
of
the
the
proportion
proportion
in
in
2040
2040
for
for
Sweden
Sweden
.
.

The
level
is
higher
in
developing
parts
of
the
world
that
what
can
be
concluded
from
the
chart
.

40
years
old
and
about
20
year
old
students
have
the
same
position
(
around
20
%
)
.

I
think
,
that
our
everyday
life
now
is
better
then
life
in
country
without
good
economic
structure
.

They
believe
,
that
it
is
essential
for
the
youth
to
understand
nature
.

There
is
a
fact
that
technologies
has
a
harmful
effect
on
the
health
.

The
lack
of
fruits
in
countries
with
cold
climate
,
for
example
,
can
cause
immune
problems
.

It
can
be
seen
that
he
biggest
part
of
railway
transportation
was
taken
by
metals
with
35
%
while
the
second
chart
shows
the
food
production
was
the
biggest
part
and
accounts
for
30
%
.

But
,
by
the
contrast
,
females
have
higher
proportion
of
undegraduates
diplomas
and
Bachelor
's
degree
.

However
,
I
ca
n't
agree
with
this
statement
,
because
it
demands
a
huge
sum
of
money
,
whereas
spending
money
on
medicine
and
poverty
are
more
cheaper
.

Moreover
,
by
such
act
of
altruism
,
we
can
achieve
an
eternal
gratitude
from
the
saved
nations
,
wich
we
can
use
in
our
own
interests
.

However
,
there
is
a
point
of
view
that
increasing
the
number
of
sports
facilities
would
have
little
effect
on
public
health
.

Thirdly
,
it
is
important
to
produce
more
food
than
your
country
can
eat
because
of
different
accedent
and
wether
anomalies
.

Firstly
,
it
is
harder
to
communicate
in
the
group
of
the
same
gender
.

Personal
charactiristics
transform
as
a
consequence
of
everyday
experience
.

As
for
winter
,
index
increase
twice
and
reach
a
peak
between
21
and
24
hours
.

Water
clearing
equipment
or
car
emissions
filters
are
effective
but
very
difficult
to
get
,
prepare
and
use
.

In
Rio
de
Janeiro
o
cold
weather
is
impossible
:
it
is
munimum
is
about
17
degrees
.

These
are
Instagram
,
where
age
group
reaches
the
peak
of
53
percent
and
Facebook
.

Nowadays
more
and
more
people
are
concerned
about
their
lifestyle
and
their
health
.

Moreover
,
87
percent
of
online
users
are
people
by
the
age
group
from
18
to
29
.

Government
should
give
a
total
freedom
or
restrict
some
points
?

The
same
pattern
is
concerned
for
food
products
,
however
,
it
is
reversed
(
11
%
by
rail
and
30
%
by
road
)
.

Nowadays
there
exist
an
opinion
that
univercities
should
provide
every
subject
with
an
equal
number
of
male
&
female
students
.

On
On
the
the
one
one
hand
hand
,
,
earning
earning
more
more
money
money
can
can
lead
lead
to
to
the
the
better
better
living
living
conditions
conditions
and
and
the
the

of

.
.

There
are
projections
,
that
number
of
children
in
Yemen
will
decrease
significantly
,
from
50,1
%
in
2000
to
37
%
in
2050
.

In
2050
the
both
\"
15
-
59
years
\"
and
\"
60
+
years
\"
grops
wiil
be
almost
equal
.

On
the
other
hand
,
people
get
character
from
birth
and
for
some
human
beings
it
is
hard
to
work
on
themselves
.

So
,
such
a
trend
makes
modern
art
more
widespread
and
affordable
for
all
social
classes
.

And
people
living
in
countries
without
the
developed
film
industries
simply
do
not
have
an
option
to
wath
films
produced
locally
and
they
obviously
watch
American
,
British
(
and
so
on
)
films
.

The
most
notable
features
of
the
diagram
is
thet
the
USA
got
more
profit
from
both
Printed
Books
and
eBooks
while
Germany
and
Chine
did
not
get
much
revenue
from
electronic
books
in
2014
.

Overall
,
as
it
is
shown
by
tables
,
there
are
certain
trends
in
different
employment
areas
between
male
and
female
workers
.

Finally
,
it
grew
to
about

upbringing
and
later

not
be
the
only
thing
affecting
a
person
as
they
grow
and
learn
.

It
is
immediately
apparent
that
the

of
