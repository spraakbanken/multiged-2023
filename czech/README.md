Grammar Error Correction Corpus for Czech ([GECCC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05590.pdf)) consists of 83,058 sentences and covers four diverse domains, including essays written by native students, informal website texts, essays written by Romani ethnic minority children and teenagers and essays written by nonnative speakers. All domains are professionally annotated for GEC errors in a unified manner, and errors were automatically categorized with a Czech-specific version of the ERRor ANnotation Toolkit ([ERRANT](https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant)), released [here](https://github.com/ufal/errant_czech). For more details see [Naplava et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05590.pdf). Only essays written by non-native learners of Czech are included in the MultiGED datasets.
